Mokai Cyber is an Indigenous-owned cybersecurity consultancy that works as a prime contractor rather than just a recruiter. Instead of clients hiring individual cyber experts directly, Mokai manages the whole engagement: we source and vet specialists from our network, then deliver the work under Mokai’s brand while handling compliance, insurance, and assurance frameworks (like ISO 27001 and the Essential Eight). Government and corporate clients prefer this model because they can sole-source through Indigenous procurement rules, get one accountable partner for quality and risk, and still access top cyber talent. The contractors get paid by Mokai, and Mokai earns revenue by charging the client the full contract fee, keeping a management margin, and paying the specialist day rates.

In short: Jack’s idea = the delivery engine. Mokai’s job = build the procurement and assurance wrapper that makes this sellable and scalable.
