Hi Harry,

Trust that you are well.

Apologies for the slightly delayed response.

I would recommend that your Trust (HS Family Trust) own the Shares in the Company Mok House Pty Ltd.

That was any Dividends paid from Profits in the Company, can be paid to your Family Trust. Your Discretionary Family Trust, can then determine where the Trust Distributions is paid out – part to you, part to your wife or another family member, etc.

I will speak to you about this too – when I give you a call later this week. Will lock in a time in my response to your other email.

Hi Harry,

Can I give you a call at 2 pm this Wednesday, the 15th of October to discuss your email below & gather some additional information from you?

We can then assist with setting up of the Company & any other assistance that you may need.

I will send you a Teams Meeting invite for this time.

Thanks Harry.
