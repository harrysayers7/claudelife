---

## Phase 1: Project Creation from Brief

### Step 1: Identify Brief Email

**Use:** `search_gmail_messages` or `read_gmail_thread`

**Look for:**

- Emails from known clients (Electric Sheep Music, Panda Candy, etc.)
- Subject lines containing "brief", "project", or client names
- Google Docs links in email body
- Project deadlines or requirements

### Step 2: Extract Google Doc Link

**From the email, extract:**

- Google Docs URL (https://docs.google.com/document/d/...)
- Any contextual information from the email
- Sender details and urgency indicators

### Step 3: Fetch Brief Content

**Use:** `google_drive_fetch` with document ID from URL

**Extract these details:**

- Project name/campaign name
- Client/brand name
- Brief description/summary
- Target audience
- Platform (TV, digital, social media)
- Duration requirements
- Due date
- Budget/fee information
- Creative direction
- Reference materials
- Any special requirements

### Step 4: Create Obsidian Project File

**Use:** `mcp-obsidian:obsidian_put_content`

**File naming:** `[YYMMDD]-[project-name-slug].md`
**Location:** `/Users/harrysayers/Developer/claudelife/02-projects/mokhouse/[filename].md`

**Populate markdown template with:**
`````yaml
---
relation:
  - "[[mokhouse-projects]]"
project name: "[Extracted project name]"
customer: "[Client name]"
status: "Brief Received"
demo fee: [Amount or leave blank]
award fee: [Amount or leave blank]
due date: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
date received: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
internal review: ""
Date Paid: ""
PO: ""
"Invoice #": ""
submitted date: ""
paid: false
awarded: false
APRA: false
12 FOS: [true/false - based on brief requirements]
---
`````

### Step 5: Fill Brief Summary Section with Improved Formatting

**Use this structure with proper spacing and callouts:**

> [!NOTE]
> ## Details:
>
> **JOB NUMBER:** [number]
> **AGENCY:** [agency]
> **CLIENT:** [client]
> **PRODUCT:** [product]
> **LENGTH:** [duration]

> [!DELIVERABLES]
>
> - [List all deliverables from brief]
> - [Each on separate line]

> [!TRACK LENGTH]
>
> [Track length requirements and details]
````YYMMDD_[JobNumber]_[Client]_3A_Mus.wav```

---

## [Project Name] Brief

**CREATIVE DIRECTION:**

[Brief content with proper line breaks and spacing]


**TONE & EMOTION:**

[Content with proper spacing between paragraphs]


**INSTRUMENTATION:**

[Content with proper spacing between paragraphs]


**STRUCTURE:**

[Content with proper spacing between paragraphs]


**CLIENT FEEDBACK:**

[Content with proper spacing between paragraphs]

---
````

### Step 6: Generate AI Suggestions with Improved Format

**Use the embedded prompt in the markdown file:**

Execute this prompt with the brief information:

> Act as a world-class composer, vocalist, and sonic branding strategist for memorable, emotional, and brand-driven jingles and sonic identities across TV, digital, and social media.
>
> Given the creative brief above (brand, audience, platform, messaging, tone, duration, and key campaign goals), generate:
>
> - Catchy, emotionally resonant jingle lyrics and concepts (≤30s) tailored to platform and audience
> - Melody style & feel (describe musical genre, tempo, instrumentation, and overall mood)
> - Sound design/production ideas (instruments, FX, mnemonic motifs, and transitions)
> - A short, reusable sonic logo/audio mnemonic if appropriate
> - Concise creative intent paragraph connecting concept to the brand's goals

**Format as:**
````markdown
## AI Suggestions

> [!NOTE]
> **Creative Concept:**
>
> [Generated creative direction with proper spacing]
>
>
> **Musical Direction:**
>
> - **Genre:** [genre]
> - **Tempo:** [tempo with reasoning]
> - **Key Elements:** [elements]
>
>
> **Sound Design Ideas:**
>
> - Opening: [description]
> - Drop: [description]
> - Texture: [description]
> - [Special moments]: [description]
>
>
> **Sonic Logo/Audio Mnemonic:**
>
> [Description of memorable audio element]
>
>
> **Creative Intent:**
>
> [Paragraph connecting concept to brand goals]
````

### Step 7: Generate SUNO Prompt (1000 Characters Max)

**Use the embedded SUNO prompt template:**

Execute this prompt:

> You are a music prompt assistant. Given a jingle project brief, generate a detailed SUNO AI prompt using the following format - ensure the output is less than 1000 characters:
>
> [Title: {Project or Track Name}] [Genre: {Main genre or hybrid style}] [Mood: {3–5 emotional descriptors}] [Instruments: {Primary + supporting instruments}] [Structure: {Overall flow, e.g. Intro → Build → Climax → Outro}] [Tempo: {Approx BPM or feel: slow, mid-tempo, fast}]

**Format as code block:**
````markdown
## SUNO prompt
````

[Title: Project Name] [Genre: Style] [Mood: 3-5 descriptors] [Instruments: List] [Structure: Flow] [Tempo: BPM/feel]

[Intro 00:00-00:XX] Description [Build 00:XX-00:XX] Description
[Drop 00:XX-00:XX] Description [Main 00:XX-00:XX] Description [Outro 00:XX-end] Description

Requirements: [Key requirements]

**Critical:** Maximum 1000 characters total (not words)

### Step 8: Complete File Structure
````markdown
---

## Creative References

- **Reference Tracks:** [tracks]

- **Client Notes:** [notes]

- **Mood/Style:** [style notes]

---

> [!NOTE]
> ## Other relevant info:
>
> **Original Reference:** [if replacing existing track]
>
> **Key Challenge:** [main creative challenge]
>
> **Sync Points:** [timing requirements]
>
> **Special Moments:** [specific requirements]

## Links & Files

- **Ref Folder:** /references/[project-name]/

- **Google Doc:** [original brief URL]

- **Obsidian Links:** [[mokhouse-projects]]

- **Video Links:**
	- [link] <if required>
````

### Step 9: Confirm Project Creation

**Provide summary:**
````
✅ Project Created from Brief
────────────────────────────
Project: [project name]
Client: [customer]
Due Date: [due date]
Brief Source: [Google Doc URL]
File Created: [filename].md
Location: /Users/harrysayers/Developer/claudelife/02-projects/mokhouse/
Status: Brief Received

AI Suggestions: ✓ Generated
SUNO Prompt: ✓ Generated (1000 char limit)
Next: Create demo, then mark as submitted
────────────────────────────
````

---

## Phase 2: Project Submission Tracking

### When Demo is Completed and Submitted:

**Use:** `mcp-obsidian:obsidian_patch_content` to update:

- Status: "Submitted"
- submitted date: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
- wav name: "[Actual filename if different]"

**Command example:** "Mark [project name] as submitted"

---

## Phase 3: PO Receipt & Invoice Creation

### Step 1: Identify Customer from PO

**When PO is received:**

1. Extract customer name from PO document
2. Query Supabase `contacts` table to check if customer exists
3. If customer found → proceed with their stored preferences
4. If customer NOT found → trigger customer setup (Step 1a)

### Step 1a: New Customer Setup (if needed)

**Prompt user for:**

- Customer legal name (e.g., "Panda Candy Pty Ltd")
- Display name (e.g., "Panda Candy")
- Email address
- ABN (optional)
- Payment terms (default: 14 days)
- GST handling: "Charge GST" or "No GST" (default: ask user)
- Stripe invoice template name (e.g., "Panda Candy", "ESM Invoice Template")

**Create contact record in Supabase:**
````json
{
  "entity_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440002",
  "contact_type": "customer",
  "name": "[Legal name]",
  "display_name": "[Display name]",
  "email": "[Email]",
  "abn": "[ABN or null]",
  "payment_terms_days": [Days],
  "is_active": true,
  "stripe_customer_id": "[Stripe customer ID if exists, or null]"
}
````

**Link to Stripe customer:**

- Use `list_customers` to find existing Stripe customer by email
- If not found, inform user (don't auto-create Stripe customers)
- Store Stripe customer ID in contact record

### Step 2: Update Obsidian Project

**Use:** `mcp-obsidian:obsidian_patch_content` to update:

- Status: "PO Received"
- PO: "[PO number without prefix]"
- customer: "[Customer name]"

### Step 3: Check Supabase for Duplicate Invoices

Before creating invoice, query Supabase `invoices` table:

**Look for matching:**
- `purchase_order_number` = "[PO number]"
- `contact_id` = "[Customer contact ID]"

**If duplicate found:**
- Warn user with existing invoice details
- Ask if they want to proceed anyway

**If no duplicate:**
- Proceed to invoice creation

### Step 4: Prepare Invoice Details

**Retrieve customer preferences from Supabase contact:**

- Payment terms days
- Email address
- Stripe customer ID
- Display name

**Determine GST handling:**

**Known GST Rules:**
- Electric Sheep Music: No GST (legacy agreement)
- Panda Candy: No GST (per agreement)
- New customers: Ask user explicitly

**If GST is charged:**
- Subtotal = PO amount ÷ 1.1
- GST = Subtotal × 0.1
- Total = PO amount

**If NO GST charged:**
- Subtotal = PO amount
- GST = 0
- Total = PO amount

### Step 5: Confirm Invoice Details Before Creation

**Present summary and WAIT for approval:**
````
Invoice Details
────────────────────────────
Client: [Customer legal name]
Job Number: [Job number]
PO Number: PO-[####]
Description: [Project description]

Amount (excl GST): $[amount] AUD
GST: $[gst] AUD ([GST % or "No GST"])
Total: $[total] AUD

Product Line: [Description] PO-[####]
Due: [Due date] ([payment terms] days)
Issue Date: [Today's date]

Issued By: MOK HOUSE PTY LTD
Customer: [Customer legal name]
Email: [Customer email]
Stripe Customer ID: [Stripe ID]

Integrations: Stripe ✓ | Obsidian ✓ | Supabase ✓
Template: [Template name]
────────────────────────────

Proceed with invoice creation?
````

**Do NOT proceed without explicit user approval.**

### Step 6: Create Invoice in Stripe

**Stop immediately if any step fails. Order:**

1. **Verify customer exists** (`list_customers` with email)
   - If not found, inform user and stop
2. **Create product** (`create_product`)
   - Name: "[Description] PO-[####]"
   - Description: "Demo Fee for Job [####]"
3. **Create price** (`create_price`)
   - Amount: [Total amount] × 100 (convert AUD to cents)
   - Currency: "aud"
4. **Create draft invoice** (`create_invoice`)
   - Customer: [Stripe customer ID]
   - Days until due: [Payment terms from contact]
5. **Add line item** (`create_invoice_item`)
   - Invoice: [Invoice ID]
   - Price: [Price ID]
6. **Finalize invoice** (`finalize_invoice`)
   - Returns: invoice number + hosted URL

### Step 7: Record Invoice in Supabase

**Immediately after Stripe finalization, insert into `invoices` table:**

**Fixed values:**
- `entity_id`: `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440002` (MOK HOUSE PTY LTD)
- `invoice_type`: `receivable`

- `gst_amount`: [GST amount]
- `total_amount`: [Total]
- `purchase_order_number`: [PO number without "PO-" prefix]
- `description`: [Project description]
- `project`: [Project name]

### Step 8: Update Obsidian Project

**Use:** `mcp-obsidian:obsidian_patch_content` to update:

- Status: "Invoiced"
- "Invoice #": "[Invoice number from Stripe]"

### Step 9: Provide Complete Success Report

**Final summary includes:**
````
