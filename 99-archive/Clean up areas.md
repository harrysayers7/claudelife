Add to /janitor - ensure all files in 01-areas, 02-projects and 04-resources has proper frontmatter:

Ie if file is in business/mokai then relation should be [[mokai]]

Create a script that makes this process faster

Also add tags to files that relate to existing tags and only add new tags if you find genuine new connections
