So it can work inside the new accountant slash command that we created.

I'm super skeptical of this fix that Claude made. I'm just listing it below so we remember.

  Summary: Fixed Graphiti MCP

  Problem: The MCP configuration had incorrect uv run arguments:
  - Had both --isolated and --project . which conflicted with --directory

  Solution: Removed the problematic arguments:
  "args": [
    "run",
    "--directory",
    "/Users/harrysayers/Developer/claudelife/graphiti_mcp_server",
    "graphiti_mcp_server.py",
    "--transport",
    "stdio"
  ]
