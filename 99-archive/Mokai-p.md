Here's a bit of a summary. So we're currently just waiting for Jack to get his  family trust set up. Once that's set up, we can register Mokai properly with an ACN and ABN.

So no, Mokai is not officially registered yet. Once we get that info, we can set it up ourselves. Once we have our ACN and ABN, we will go for a Site Supply Nation certification. I own 51%, Jack owns 49%, Kel is COO.

No, we don't have insurance yet.
To my understanding, Jack already has his network aware of this business that we're setting up and would have the NDAs and subcontractor contracts and payment terms already ready to go.  Or at least we'd have the templates to set it up quite quickly.


I'm still in the process of learning everything in the operations guide. I've read some of it, but I've sort of been busy with other things. But I'm trying to read a little bit of it each day and use the flashcards, etc., that Obsidian has set up.

I'm not aware of how many contractors Jack has right now, but I believe he's got a fairly decent network for us to work with.
 I don't myself have any potential first clients, which is why Jack is here as part of the business. He has the network.
  Kel (Kelly) is working on the website and capability statements.  Which are mostly Finished.
   Still need to do the final touches on the constitution, the board agreement, and the shareholders agreement.

 I'm still uncertain of what services Jack thinks we should sell first. Maybe that's something I need to put in tasks to understand from his end.  Would you have any recommendations on the easiest to sell?

  In terms of client conversations, I believe Jack has spoken to a few of his colleagues and his network, and we are looking to, once we get Supply Nation certified, we'll be going to register on the board, the panel, sorry, government panels to get Makai in the limelight for proper government level work.

 Scale of 1 to 10 on outreach and pitching, I would say 1 out of 10. I'm not feeling comfortable about that just yet.

  Realistically, I could probably dedicate five to seven hours a day with Mokai.
   I have other streams of income, including from my other business, Mokai, which is a creative agency. You can refer to /Users/harrysayers/Developer/claudelife/01-areas/business/mokhouse for more context

 The most urgent, burning priority is to just learn how to be a smart businessman and handle the business side of things with communication and just talking the talk and sounding like I know what I'm doing, understanding to some degree about cybersecurity, but obviously my expertise will be more in the business process. which is is somewhat outlined in the /Users/harrysayers/Developer/claudelife/01-areas/business/mokai/docs/research/ðŸ“˜ - OPERATIONS GUIDE.md

 I think I just need to firstly read through the operations guide just to fully understand the whole process of this business and industry, and then I'd probably want to start focusing on a little bit more about cybersecurity and then maybe formulating a proper plan to execute once we get this business all registered.
 I think I will be able to explain well enough the IPP and Exemption 16 details to a buyer.

  Technical confidence: Jack will probably be handling 99% of this, but as I said, I'd like to have a little bit of knowledge about it - how it all works - but I might also learn that as we go.

   If I had a magic wand or one thing to be handled to move Mokai forward, it would either be getting the business registered and building a solid foundation for executing this whole plan that we're discussing now.


### 7. Learning & Readiness

- **Operations Guide:**Â Which modules feel most critical to master first?
- **Indigenous procurement:**Â Do you feel confident explaining IPP/MSA/Exemption 16 to buyers?
- **Technical confidence:**Â Can you speak credibly about Essential Eight/IRAP to clients, or does Jack need to lead those conversations?

## The Key Question

**If you could wave a magic wand and have ONE thing handled this week to move MOKAI forward, what would it be?**

Â 

(This tells me what's really blocking you vs. whatÂ _should_Â be blocking you)

Answer what you can - even partial answers help. I'll build a realistic 30/60/90 day plan based on YOUR actual starting point, not a theoretical startup.
