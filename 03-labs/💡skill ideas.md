list me 10 skills for a second brain type skill

For a “second brain” setup — a knowledge management system that helps you **capture, connect, and retrieve ideas** — Claude Code can use specialized **Skills** that act like cognitive plugins. These skills create persistent workflows around reading, organizing, and reasoning with your notes, similar to what advanced users run alongside Obsidian or Notion [1][2][3].

Here are 10 skills tailored for a Second Brain-style workflow:

***

### 1. Vault Navigator
Indexes your entire knowledge vault (e.g., in Obsidian) and creates a fast-search interface so Claude can pull related ideas, tags, or backlinks instantly [1][3].

***

### 2. Note Synthesizer
Summarizes clusters of notes into unified concepts. When multiple documents discuss related topics, this skill merges them into concise overviews with linked context [1][4].

***

### 3. Daily Reflection Log
Automates daily journaling and synthesis. Each day it creates entries that track focus areas, mood, and new learnings — drawing from chat history or entries tagged "reflection" [1][2].

***

### 4. Knowledge Graph Builder
Generates a living map of ideas and links between notes. For example, it detects relationships like “Project X → Article Y → Research Z” and updates metadata accordingly [3][4].

***

### 5. Task Context Retriever
When you open a project, this skill fetches the last conversations, relevant documents, and open threads so you can resume where you left off with full context memory [1][5].

***

### 6. Meeting Brain
Captures meeting recordings or transcripts, generates action items, and connects them to relevant tasks or notes in your vault — acting as an “Inbox” skill for inputs [6][7].

***

### 7. Idea Incubator
Lets you brainstorm or develop half-formed ideas. Claude asks Socratic-style questions, logs the conversation, and links it to relevant past concepts or experiments [2][8].

***

### 8. Source Clip Manager
Imports highlights from PDFs, emails, and web sources into structured markdown notes with metadata like author, tags, and related concepts [3][4].

***

### 9. Research Resumer
When you say “catch me up on my last 3 days of research,” this skill fetches recent activity logs and outputs a knowledge digest including citations and insights [1][2].

***

### 10. Reflection Synthesizer
Periodically condenses weeks of logs, notes, and projects into summaries of evolving themes, areas of focus, and potential next steps — effectively functioning as a “thinking mirror” [1][2].

***

These skills can live as separate folders inside `~/.claude/skills/`, each with its own `SKILL.md` and helper scripts. Together, they form the foundation for a **Claude-powered Second Brain** — an intelligent memory layer that grows with your projects, reflections, and research.
