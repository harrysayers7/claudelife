# LABS System Context

## Purpose

**Labs** is a dedicated experimental zone within PARA for active exploration that doesn't fit elsewhere:

- Testing new tools/plugins before committing
- Proof-of-concept automation scripts
- Research that might become a project
- "What if I tried..." explorations
- Learning experiments (new frameworks, languages)
- Half-formed ideas worth documenting
