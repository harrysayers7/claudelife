### <font color="#8064a2">BRIEF</font>


**CREATIVE DIRECTION:**
Replace "This Is How We Do It" by Montell Jordan with an instrumental track that achieves the same emotional switch feeling. Cannot be a sound alike of "This Is How We Do It".

**TONE & EMOTION:**
Chilled but cool. Big switch from the start of the ad.

**INSTRUMENTATION:**
Hip Hop seems to go to the right place but open to being surprised. Again - chilled but cool is the key.

**STRUCTURE:**
Follow the structure of the existing ad. There is a moment at the end when the lizard is singing - if you can link in some kind of vocalisation they would love it but it's not a priority. Stay away from "la la la" like Montell Jordan.

**CLIENT FEEDBACK:**
"The most 'fun hype-up' energy with the chill undertones and a strong drum intro to kick-off the beat is ideal. We just have to make sure it doesn't skew too retro or disco, hip hop is great but nothing too old school. Still has to feel modern and fresh."

### <font color="#8064a2">AI Suggestions</font>

> [!NOTE]
> **Creative Concept:**
> Create a modern hip-hop instrumental that delivers the "scene change" energy without being a Montell Jordan sound-alike. Focus on a strong drum intro that builds anticipation, then drops into a chilled but confident groove.
>
> **Musical Direction:**
> - **Genre:** Contemporary Hip-Hop with trap influences
> - **Tempo:** Mid-tempo (85-95 BPM) to maintain cool factor while building energy
> - **Key Elements:** Strong drum intro, bass-heavy drops, subtle melodic hooks
>
> **Sound Design Ideas:**
> - Opening: Clean, punchy drum pattern with hi-hat rolls building tension
> - Drop: Deep 808 bass with crisp snares, creating the "scene change" moment
> - Texture: Subtle synth pads, filtered vocal chops (not "la la la")
> - Lizard moment: Quick vocal stab or sound effect that matches his lip sync
>


### SUNO prompt
********
> [!NOTE]
> **Title:** XXXX Ultra Scene Change
> **Genre:** Modern Hip-Hop/Trap Instrumental
> **Mood:** Confident, chilled, cool, hype-building, fresh
> **Instruments:** 808 drums, crisp snares, filtered synths, bass guitar, subtle vocal chops
> **Structure:** Intro → Build → Drop → Groove → Lizard Moment → Outro
> **Tempo:** 90 BPM (mid-tempo groove)
>
> **[Intro 00:00-00:04]** Clean, minimal drum pattern with subtle hi-hat work. Building anticipation with filtered elements creeping in. Sets up the scene change moment.
>
> **[Build 00:04-00:08]** Drums get fuller, add subtle bass movement. Hi-hats start rolling, creating tension. Filtered synth pad enters softly in background.
>
> **[Drop 00:08-00:12]** Full 808 bass hits hard, crisp snare pattern locks in. This is the "scene change" moment - needs to feel like a gear shift. Bass riff becomes prominent.
>
> **[Main Groove 00:12-00:25]** Locked-in pocket with 808s and snares. Add subtle melodic elements - maybe filtered guitar or synth stabs. Keep it chilled but confident. Bass riff repeats as hook.
>
> **[Lizard Moment 00:25-00:27]** Brief vocal stab or sound effect that could sync with lizard's mouth movement. Quick, punchy, not melodic.
>
> **[Outro 00:27-00:30]** Drums continue, some elements filter out to create natural ending that could loop back or fade.
>
> **Requirements:** Modern production, no vintage/retro elements, strong low-end, crisp percussion, scene-change energy, instrumental only, sync-friendly structure.
