## Business Context & Strategy

### Multi-Business Income Strategy (Added: 2025-10-19)

**Context**: Harry operates two Indigenous-owned businesses:
1. **MOKAI PTY LTD**: Cybersecurity consultancy (early-stage, building to profitability)
2. **MOK HOUSE PTY LTD**: Creative house (MOK Music active, MOK Studio future)

**Strategic Pattern**: When one business is ramping up (MOKAI), diversify income through the other (MOK HOUSE) to maintain financial stability.

**Revenue Diversification Framework** (for MOK HOUSE while MOKAI grows):

#### Pattern 1: Expand Competitive Submission Channels
- **Principle**: More agencies = more opportunities without changing workflow
- **Action**: Build 3-5 agency relationships vs. relying on 1-2
- **Example**: Add The Producers, Sonar Music, Squeak E Clean to ESM relationship
- **Indigenous Advantage**: RAP/IPP positioning attracts government/corporate briefs

#### Pattern 2: Pursue Predictable Retainer Income
- **Principle**: Trade time for guaranteed monthly revenue vs. competitive wins
- **Action**: Target government departments with RAP commitments
- **IPP Sweet Spot**: Under $80k/year contracts = no tender required for Indigenous businesses
- **Example**: $4,000-$5,000/month sonic branding retainer = $48k-$60k/year guaranteed
- **Service Package**: Ongoing audio assets, music libraries, brand consultation

#### Pattern 3: Offer Non-Competitive Production Services
- **Principle**: Guaranteed work that starts when accepted (no pitch/win cycle)
- **Action**: Mixing, mastering, audio post-production for studios/podcasters
- **Pricing**: $500-$1,500/day production rate
- **Platforms**: ProductionHub, Mandy, StarNow (Australian-focused), Upwork (high-end tier)

#### Pattern 4: Build Passive Income Streams
- **Principle**: Create once, license repeatedly (time-leveraged income)
- **Action**: Music licensing library from existing demos + new themed packs
- **Platforms**: AudioJungle, Pond5, Artlist, Epidemic Sound
- **Timeline**: 6-12 months to build meaningful revenue ($500-$1,500/month)
- **Themes**: Corporate Upbeat, Emotional Storytelling, Indigenous-inspired

#### Pattern 5: Monetize Expertise Through Education
- **Principle**: Leverage domain knowledge for consulting/teaching income
- **Action**: Sonic branding workshops, brand consulting, online courses
- **Indigenous Angle**: "Indigenous Perspectives in Sonic Branding" for RAP-committed brands
- **Pricing**: $150-$300/hr consulting, $3,000-$5,000/month with workshops
- **Distribution**: Supply Nation network, Indigenous business chambers, Teachable/Skillshare

### Implementation Timeline Pattern

**Phase 1: Immediate (2 weeks)**
- Expand agency relationships (more submissions)
- Launch audio production services (guaranteed work)
- Expected: +$2,500-$5,500/month additional income

**Phase 2: Medium-term (1-2 months)**
- Secure 1 government retainer (predictable monthly income)
- Seed licensing library (passive income foundation)
- Expected: +$9,500-$14,500/month additional income

**Phase 3: Long-term (3-6 months)**
- Establish education/consulting practice (leveraged income)
- Expected: +$14,000-$24,500/month additional income

### Business Orchestration Pattern

**When to apply this pattern**:
- One business is early-stage/building to profitability (MOKAI)
- Other business has established capabilities but inconsistent revenue (MOK HOUSE)
- Need to maintain financial stability during growth phase

**Key principle**: Diversify income streams within established business (MOK HOUSE) rather than abandoning it for new ventures. Use multi-pronged approach targeting different revenue models (competitive submissions, retainers, production services, passive income, education).

**Indigenous advantage**: Both businesses benefit from IPP procurement pathways, RAP commitments, Supply Nation certification (pending). Position creative services (MOK HOUSE) to government/corporate clients meeting Indigenous procurement goals while cybersecurity business (MOKAI) builds client base.
