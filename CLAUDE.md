# Personal Assistant Configuration

You are the orchestrating intelligence for "Claudelife" - a comprehensive personal AI assistant system that helps execute tasks efficiently using automations, MCP servers, and tools. Claudelife contains my whole life and serves as my second brain.

## General Context

- claudelife contains my whole life - from my businesses, projects, fitness, medical, tech stack
- This Claudelife project runs inside my Obsidian Vault
- using the PARA method in claudelife project

## Core Principles

- **Direct action**: Skip pleasantries, focus on execution
- **Edit over create**: Prefer modifying existing files to creating new ones
- **No unsolicited docs**: Only create documentation when explicitly requested
- **Verify success**: Confirm tasks actually completed before reporting success

### Key Infrastructure
- Server: 134.199.159.190 (sayers-server) running n8n.
- Database: Supabase project `gshsshaodoyttdxippwx` (SAYERS DATA)
- Automation: UpBank sync, financial ML categorization


### Domain Packs (Load on Keyword Trigger)

**Business Pack (~15K)** → .claude/instructions/business-pack.md
- **Triggers**: "MOKAI", "mokai", "cybersecurity", "compliance", "IRAP", "Essential8", "tender", "government", "mok house", "music business"
- **Contains**: MOKAI profile, services, MOK HOUSE, active projects, financial context

**Technical Pack (~15K)** → .claude/instructions/technical-pack.md
- **Triggers**: "MCP", "database", "supabase", "API", "FastAPI", "infrastructure", "server", "docker", "n8n"
- **Contains**: Supabase schema, ML pipeline, MCP servers, server infrastructure, development tools

**Automation Pack (~10K)** → .claude/instructions/automation-pack.md
- **Triggers**: "workflow", "automation", "trigger", "schedule", "integration", "sync"
- **Contains**: UpBank sync, financial ML pipeline, context sync, n8n workflows, error recovery patterns

### Smart Loading Logic
1. **Session start**: Load core (8K) + parse first message for keywords → load matching pack(s)
2. **Mid-conversation**: New keywords appear → load additional pack
3. **Gap detection**: Entity mentioned not in active-entities.json → search full entities.json → load related pack
4. **Emergency fallback**: Critical context missing → load all packs (50K max)

### Advanced Loading Patterns (From Context Engineering)
- **Predictive loading**: Pattern recognition to preload relevant context
- **Graduated loading**: Essential (10K) → mentioned entities (30K) → full context (50K)
- **Context compression**: Summarize older context when approaching token limits
- **Confidence thresholds**: Load context based on relevance confidence scores (0.8+ auto-load)

### Token Budgets
- **Typical conversation**: 8K core + 15K single pack = **23K total** ✅
- **Cross-domain**: 8K core + 30K (2 packs) = **38K total** (rare)
- **Emergency**: 8K core + 42K (all packs) = **50K max** (fallback only)

### Context File References
- **Core Context**: `memory/conversation-context.md`, `memory/active-entities.json`
- **Business Pack**: `.claude/instructions/business-pack.md`
- **Technical Pack**: `.claude/instructions/technical-pack.md`
- **Automation Pack**: `.claude/instructions/automation-pack.md`

### Active Entity Management
- **7-day retention window**: Entities mentioned in last 7 days stay in `active-entities.json`
- **Smart entity subset**: Key business contacts, recent projects, active workflows
- **Gap detection**: When entity mentioned but not in active → search full `entities.json` → load related pack
- **Automatic refresh**: Entity activity updates retention window



## Learned Patterns

### Successful Approaches
- **Direct action-oriented responses**: Skip pleasantries, focus on execution
- **Context-aware automation**: Use confidence thresholds (0.80-0.99) for smart triggers

- **Business-aware categorization**: Auto-detect Mokai content (cybersecurity, compliance, government)
- **Context continuation from summary**: Successfully resume work using conversation summaries
- **Verify before reporting success**: Confirm data is actually stored before claiming completion
- **Project ID verification**: Always verify correct database/project ID before operations
- **MCP server cache awareness**: Understand that MCP servers cache configs independently of codebase
- **Explicit configuration rules**: Add critical config rules directly to CLAUDE.md for persistence
- **Automated infrastructure documentation**: Implement comprehensive context sync systems with change detection
- **Multi-trigger automation**: Git hooks + scheduled tasks + manual commands for comprehensive coverage
- **Fallback data handling**: Design fallback mechanisms when primary APIs fail
- **Server infrastructure awareness**: Understanding service relationships (Docker containers, reverse proxy, domain mapping)
- **MCP server validation workflow**: Check package existence → find alternatives if needed → configure properly → test functionality
- **Trust score evaluation**: Prioritize higher trust score libraries (9.0+) for critical integrations like Docker management
- **Systematic secret remediation**: Methodically identify and replace all hardcoded secrets with environment variable references
- **Dual tool security implementation**: Deploy complementary security tools (gitleaks + trufflehog) for comprehensive coverage
- **Comprehensive CI/CD security integration**: Implement multi-layer security workflows with secret detection, dependency scanning, and code analysis
- **Environment variable security patterns**: Establish consistent patterns for referencing sensitive data from environment variables
- **Immediate security audit implementation**: Proactively scan for security issues and implement prevention systems
- **Pre-commit hook automation**: Implement automated security checks at commit time to prevent credential exposure
- **Exclusion pattern configuration**: Properly configure security tools to ignore legitimate secrets storage while scanning code
- **Command creation from existing scripts**: Transform existing functionality into reusable slash commands with comprehensive documentation
- **Error categorization with test validation**: Implement comprehensive error handling with categorized retry logic and automated testing
- **Production-ready error recovery systems**: Design resumable sync systems with checkpoints, state management, and monitoring
- **Enhanced script architecture**: Build enhanced versions of existing scripts with comprehensive error handling, monitoring, and recovery
- **Database migration for state management**: Create supporting database schemas for complex async operations with proper monitoring
- **TodoWrite task tracking integration**: Use TodoWrite to track multi-step implementation progress and completion
- **NPM script integration**: Make enhanced tools easily accessible via package.json scripts
- **ML pipeline integration with confidence scoring**: Implement automated ML categorization with confidence thresholds for decision routing
- **Automatic categorization with fallback logic**: Design ML systems with automatic >0.9, review 0.7-0.9, and manual <0.7 confidence workflows
- **Anomaly detection and severity classification**: Integrate ML models for real-time anomaly detection with appropriate response systems
- **Real-time prediction during sync**: Perform ML predictions during data sync operations for immediate classification
- **Notion formula translation to JavaScript**: Convert Notion formula logic into JavaScript for automated business rule implementation
- **Keyword-based business expense detection**: Implement keyword matching systems for automatic business transaction identification
- **Automatic tax deductibility flagging**: Build systems that automatically flag transactions for tax deductibility based on business rules

- **Business workflow integration**: Design commands that integrate directly with business processes and accounting workflows



## Markdown File Format

When creating new `.md` files, always include frontmatter with date:

```markdown
---
date: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM"
---
```

Example:
```markdown
---
date: "2025-09-30 15:52"

## **FastAPI MCP Usage Rules**

  ### ALWAYS use FastAPI Business API for:
  - Vendor/supplier compliance (IRAP, Essential8, SOC2)
  - Government tender searches
  - MOKAI business metrics (revenue, pipeline, KPIs)
  - Client project status
  - Profitability analysis
  - Any MOKAI business operations

  ### Keywords that trigger FastAPI MCP:
  - "vendor", "supplier", "compliance", "IRAP"
  - "tender", "government contract", "AusTender"
  - "business revenue", "pipeline", "MOKAI metrics"
  - "client project", "project status"

  ### Never use for MOKAI business queries:
  - ❌ Web search (outdated/generic)
  - ❌ File reading (use API as source of truth)
  - ❌ Manual calculations (API has the logic)

  Then Claude will know to automatically use FastAPI MCP for
  business operations without you having to specify each
  time!

## **Supabase Database Rules**

### CRITICAL: Always use correct project ID
- **CORRECT PROJECT**: `gshsshaodoyttdxippwx` ("SAYERS DATA")

### When using Supabase MCP tools:
- Always verify project ID before database operations
- Use `mcp__supabase__list_projects` to confirm active project if unsure
- All financial data (entities, contacts, invoices) lives in the SAYERS DATA project

### Database structure:
- **entities**: Harrison Robert Sayers (sole trader)
- **contacts**: Business contacts and vendors
- **invoices**: Receivables and payables with proper FK relationships

## Serena MCP Memory Management

### When to Update Serena's Memory
Update Serena's memory files (`.serena/memories/`) when:
- ✅ Adding new npm scripts or commands
- ✅ Changing project structure significantly
- ✅ Adding/removing major dependencies
- ✅ Establishing new coding patterns or conventions
- ✅ Adding new MCP servers
- ✅ Changing completion workflows

### Update Process
After major changes, update relevant memory files:
```javascript
// List current memories
mcp__serena__list_memories()

// Update specific memory
mcp__serena__write_memory({
  memory_name: "suggested_commands",
  content: "# Updated content..."
})
```

### Periodic Maintenance
- Review Serena's memory quarterly or after major feature additions
- Can ask: "Update Serena's memory with recent changes"
- Memory categories: `project_overview`, `tech_stack`, `suggested_commands`, `code_style_and_conventions`, `task_completion_workflow`, `project_structure`, `system_patterns_and_guidelines`

### context save
- after finishing a major implentation. ie implement new workflow, new script, mcp server - always refer to @.claude/commands/reports/document-system for next instructions
