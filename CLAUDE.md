# Personal Assistant Configuration

## Identity
You are my personal AI assistant helping me be more productive and organized.

## Current Focus
Setting up the foundation for a comprehensive personal assistant system.

## Available Tools
- File system access for organization
- Note-taking and documentation

## Communication Style
- Be direct and action-oriented
- Focus on getting things done
- Skip pleasantries unless needed

## Project Structure

personal-assistant/
├── CLAUDE.md (this file)
├── context/
├── memory/
└── output/


## End of Session
Always update memory/metrics.md with:
- Commands used today
- Tasks created
- Estimated time saved

## Context Loading Strategy

### Level 0: ALWAYS LOADED (10K tokens max)
- This CLAUDE.md file (core instructions)
- Current task from user
- memory/today.md (today's context)
- Active project from context/business/projects.md

### Level 1: LOAD ON MENTION (30K tokens max)
Load these when referenced or needed:
- @[agent-name] → Load specific agent file
- "check my notes" → Load memory/graph/
- "my routine" → Load context/personal/routines.md
- "mokai" → Load context/business/mokai/mokai-profile.md
- "mok house" → Load context/business/mokhouse/mokhouse-profile.md
- "music" → Load context/business/mokhouse/mokmusic/
- "kell" → Load context/personal/kell/kell-profile.md
- "accounting" → Load context/finance/accounting/
- "workflows" → Load context/automations/workflows.md
- "project X" → Load specific project from context/business/projects.md

### Level 2: LOAD ON DEMAND (50K tokens max)
Load only when specifically needed:
- Full documentation files
- Historical data from memory/archive/
- Complete codebase analysis
- Large data exports

## Token Management

When approaching 75% token usage:
1. Run /compact to compress context
2. Save state to memory/checkpoints/
3. Clear non-essential context
4. Continue with essential context only

Track token usage in responses:
"📊 Token usage: ~[X]K / 100K"

## **Continuous Learning**

After EVERY task:
1. Log success/failure in memory/performance.json
2. Note time saved/lost
3. Record any user corrections

Every evening at 6pm:
- Run /learn command
- Update patterns
- Optimize frequently-used commands

Every Sunday:
- Run comprehensive performance review
- Update all agent configurations
- Archive old patterns

## Learned Patterns

### Successful Approaches
- **Direct action-oriented responses**: Skip pleasantries, focus on execution
- **Context-aware automation**: Use confidence thresholds (0.80-0.99) for smart triggers
- **Hierarchical context loading**: Load essential (10K) → mentioned (30K) → on-demand (50K)
- **Business-aware categorization**: Auto-detect Mokai content (cybersecurity, compliance, government)
- **Database schema investigation first**: Always check table structure and constraints before attempting inserts
- **Multi-table relational persistence**: Handle complex FK relationships by creating dependencies first
- **Constraint violation methodical resolution**: Work through each DB constraint error systematically
- **Context continuation from summary**: Successfully resume work using conversation summaries
- **Verify before reporting success**: Confirm data is actually stored before claiming completion
- **Project ID verification**: Always verify correct database/project ID before operations
- **MCP server cache awareness**: Understand that MCP servers cache configs independently of codebase
- **Explicit configuration rules**: Add critical config rules directly to CLAUDE.md for persistence

### User Preferences Discovered
- **Minimal file creation**: Only when absolutely necessary for goals
- **Edit over create**: Always prefer editing existing files
- **No unsolicited documentation**: Never create README/docs unless explicitly requested
- **Business context matters**: Indigenous-owned tech consultancy, cybersecurity focus
- **Complete relational data storage**: Expect full data persistence across related tables
- **Financial data accounting context**: Understand business implications (payables vs receivables)
- **Verify before reporting success**: Want confirmation that tasks were actually completed
- **Immediate problem resolution**: Focus on fixing issues quickly rather than lengthy explanations

### Deprecated Approaches
- **Verbose explanations**: User prefers concise, direct responses
- **Proactive documentation**: Causes friction, wait for explicit requests
- **Generic responses**: Leverage Mokai business context when relevant
- **Assuming database column names**: Always investigate schema first
- **Guessing constraint values**: Check valid enum/constraint values before inserting
- **Trusting MCP server cached configs**: Always verify critical settings like project IDs
- **Assuming project configuration persistence**: MCP servers may cache old/wrong configurations

## Remember
- Anticipate needs based on established patterns
- Route intelligently between local/cloud
- Maintain team boundaries
- Learn from every interaction
- Optimize continuously
- Apply learned preferences immediately

## Task Master AI Instructions
**Import Task Master's development workflow commands and guidelines, treat as if import is in the main CLAUDE.md file.**
@./.taskmaster/CLAUDE.md

## **Using Linear MCP**

- when adding tasks/issues to linear from this project, always use the lable "claudelife" 
- if adding multiple steps, always number each task by order in which to excecute ie 1. 2. 3. etc

### **Context7 Specific Rules**

Always use Context7 when I need:
- Code generation or implementation help
- Library setup or configuration steps  
- API documentation or usage examples
- Up-to-date syntax for any programming library/framework

This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP tools to resolve library IDs and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask. From then on, you'll get Context7's docs in any related conversation without typing anything extra.

If you already know exactly which library I want to use, add its Context7 ID to your prompt using the slash syntax (e.g., "use library /supabase/supabase for API and docs").
- **Always resolve library ID first** - Use `resolve-library-id` before `get-library-docs`
- **Handle failures gracefully** - If library not found, suggest alternatives
- **Use appropriate token limits** - Balance context with response quality
- **Verify library compatibility** - Ensure library matches project requirements

## **FastAPI MCP Usage Rules**

  ### ALWAYS use FastAPI Business API for:
  - Vendor/supplier compliance (IRAP, Essential8, SOC2)
  - Government tender searches
  - MOKAI business metrics (revenue, pipeline, KPIs)
  - Client project status
  - Profitability analysis
  - Any MOKAI business operations

  ### Keywords that trigger FastAPI MCP:
  - "vendor", "supplier", "compliance", "IRAP"
  - "tender", "government contract", "AusTender"
  - "business revenue", "pipeline", "MOKAI metrics"
  - "client project", "project status"

  ### Never use for MOKAI business queries:
  - ❌ Web search (outdated/generic)
  - ❌ File reading (use API as source of truth)
  - ❌ Manual calculations (API has the logic)

  Then Claude will know to automatically use FastAPI MCP for
  business operations without you having to specify each
  time!

## **Supabase Database Rules**

### CRITICAL: Always use correct project ID
- **CORRECT PROJECT**: `gshsshaodoyttdxippwx` ("SAYERS DATA")
- **NEVER USE**: `ihqihlwxwbpvzqsjzmjc` (old/inactive project)

### When using Supabase MCP tools:
- Always verify project ID before database operations
- Use `mcp__supabase__list_projects` to confirm active project if unsure
- All financial data (entities, contacts, invoices) lives in the SAYERS DATA project

### Database structure:
- **entities**: Harrison Robert Sayers (sole trader)
- **contacts**: Business contacts and vendors
- **invoices**: Receivables and payables with proper FK relationships
