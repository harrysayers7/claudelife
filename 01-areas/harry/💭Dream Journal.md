Got a Uber wheel chair through Canberra going to the airport. Ended up in the brindy mountains but it was covered in snow, Uber driver was doing jumps. Took me to Bowral airport which was in the snowys where a festival was on. 

Skipped that and ended ups snow boarding and found a girl yelling out who had a splinter in her toe, and there just happened to be tweezers on the ground as I got closer to her but I couldn’t get it out.

Party at hall but I missed it cos I was having sex with Emily Boyd but I stopped cos it was cheatin

-

Leg cut off at shin. Swap with kel. Super painful. Had the morphine whistle

Was at hall primary. People were lining up to kill themselves. Was interested as to why, so some person (from my point of view) faked their death to see where all the dead people were going. Was on a train track and had to act dead. Ended up in a flood of dead people. 



24/2/20

Dad found me n kel a job. Went to interview, Turned out being shellfish cookers and would have to work in 50-60 degree heat, we turned it down and drove away in a manual Ute. 



31/3/20

In Melbourne, went to bar, security asked if I had drugs on me. I had coke and md. They found the large bag on md in my bag and he confiscated it. I immediately started crying and he felt bad so gave it back cos I said it costed $550. 

I later handed him a $50 for being a mad cunt. 

Left the bar because it was weird and went quiet. 



Later I was driving people home from civic, Ben pissed me off cos he told me later that he was staying at mikalyas which was in McKellar, threw codes in back of Ute cos she was running next to us. 

Somehow turned into me running through a gay parade with Ben the gay dude on my back. 

Turned into me intercepting a call between mick  n Ben. I was outside his apt. We met and they were discussing artwork for a new single called ‘dance stay alive’ with a cartoon picture of a mans fat face as the artwork. I felt left out. 

I ran to tays apt in same complex which was full of ppl working in cubicles on a Saturday, I went out side to try get to breezy place which was two apts over. I wanted the weed on his balcony. I rang Claire and went to theirs. I woke up.

Credible was in jail, I sent him a pen with naked lady on it. He was so stoked and he tagged me in the discord saying thank you



21 June 2025

I have re occurring dream where I either have killed someone or found them dead. And I bury them somewhere in Hall and I’m constantly stressed that I’m gonna get caught or the body will be found. 

I wonder why I didn’t just go to the cops (if I had found them dead)

Always freaks me out and seems so real
