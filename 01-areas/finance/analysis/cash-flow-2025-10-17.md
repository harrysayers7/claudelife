## üö® Critical Action Required

### 1. Chase Overdue Invoices ($6,000)

**Immediate Actions**:
- **Invoice NLOLWU0R-0003** ($4,500): Contact client immediately - 5 days overdue
- **Invoice NLOLWU0R-0002** ($500): Follow up - 5 days overdue
- **Invoice NLOLWU0R-0007** ($500): Send reminder - 2 days overdue
- **Invoice NLOLWU0R-0006** ($500): Send reminder - 2 days overdue

**Cash Impact**: Collecting these overdue invoices brings in $6,000 to MOK HOUSE

**Use Commands**:
```bash
/mokhouse-update-status --invoice=NLOLWU0R-0003 --follow-up
/mokhouse-update-status --invoice=NLOLWU0R-0002 --follow-up
/mokhouse-update-status --invoice=NLOLWU0R-0007 --follow-up
/mokhouse-update-status --invoice=NLOLWU0R-0006 --follow-up
```

### 2. Update Bank Balance Data

**Last Updated**: September 22 (25 days stale)

**Actions**:
- Run UpBank sync to refresh personal account balance
- Update MOK HOUSE business account balance manually or via bank integration
- Update MOKAI accounts (if active)

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Immediate Invoice Collection ($6,000)
- **What**: Contact clients with overdue invoices totaling $6,000
- **Why**: 92% of receivables are overdue - critical cash flow issue
- **How**:
  1. Send formal payment reminder emails (use templates)
  2. Follow up with phone calls if no response within 48 hours
  3. Consider payment plans for $4,500 invoice if needed
  4. Update invoice status in Supabase after collection
- **When**: Today/Tomorrow
- **Risk**: If uncollected, MOK HOUSE has no cash flow for operations

### Priority 2: Personal Savings Runway Analysis
- **What**: Calculate how long current personal savings will last
- **Why**: MOK HOUSE not yet profitable for salary extraction
- **How**:
  ```
  Current Personal Savings: [Need UpBank balance]
  Monthly Burn Rate: $1,126.15 (Oct MTD average)
  Runway = Savings / Burn Rate
  ```
- **When**: Once UpBank balance refreshed
- **Risk**: Unknown - need current savings balance

### Priority 3: MOK HOUSE Profitability Analysis
- **What**: Determine when MOK HOUSE can support salary extraction
- **Why**: Currently living off personal savings
- **How**:
  - Calculate MOK HOUSE monthly revenue after invoices collected
  - Subtract business expenses
  - Determine sustainable monthly salary (<$45K annually = $3,750/month)
- **When**: After invoice collection
- **Risk**: May need to delay salary extraction if revenue insufficient

## Compliance & Alerts

### GST Threshold Status
‚ö†Ô∏è **No GST monitoring data found** - Need to initialize `gst_threshold_monitoring` table

**Immediate Action Required**:
```sql
-- Initialize GST monitoring for FY2025-26
INSERT INTO gst_threshold_monitoring (entity_id, financial_year, current_turnover, gst_threshold)
SELECT id, 'FY2025-26', 0, 75000
FROM entities
WHERE name IN ('MOK HOUSE PTY LTD', 'Harrison Robert Sayers');
```

**Manual Calculation** (based on receivables):
- MOK HOUSE invoiced this FY: $6,500 (from visible invoices only)
- Threshold: $75,000
- Progress: **8.7%**
- Status: ‚úÖ Well below threshold, no GST registration required yet

### Upcoming Deadlines
- **October 28, 2025**: PAYG Quarterly (if applicable)
- **October 29, 2025**: Invoice in_1SINXQP3IWAQX84K9uKg38ex due ($500)
- **October 31, 2025**: End of month - review cash flow again
