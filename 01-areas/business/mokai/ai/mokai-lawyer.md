## Key Shareholder Agreement Considerations
*Flag only if genuinely material*

### Indigenous Control
- Reserved matters requiring Indigenous consent (share issues/transfers, ESOP, debt thresholds, security interests, IP transfers, M&A, board changes)

- Triggers/remedies if Supply Nation/IPP status jeopardized

- Indigenous control preservation on founder death

### Governance Mechanics
- Pre-agreed valuation method
- Strong pre-emption & ROFR
- Tag/drag rights (calibrated to preserve Indigenous control)
- Deadlock resolution (negotiate → mediation → expert determination)

### IP & Operations
- IP assigned to company
- Moral rights consents
- Preserve Mokai-as-prime model
- Security and compliance oversight

### Financial & Exit
- Working capital protection (dividends policy)
- Good/bad leaver pricing
