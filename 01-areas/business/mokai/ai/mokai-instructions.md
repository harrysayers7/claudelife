## Financial Model

- Cloud services subscriptions: Ongoing commission/margin
- **Back-to-back transactions**: Client order → Distributor fulfillment → Mokai margin

**3. Hybrid (Bundled Solutions)**

- Products + implementation services (e.g., software license + deployment)
- Higher overall project value and client stickiness

### Cost Structure

**Services Costs:**

- Contractor payments (major cost)
- Payroll tax (6%+ above threshold - critical to include in pricing)
- Insurance (professional indemnity, cyber liability)

**Product Reselling Costs:**

- Distributor payments (majority of product sale)
- **Credit requirements**: May need net-30/60 payment terms with distributors
- **Working capital**: Pay distributor before client pays you
- Vendor partnership/registration fees

**Shared Overhead:**

- Minimal overhead (lean team, cloud-based)
- Insurance coverage for both services and product liability

### Pricing Approach

**Services Pricing:**

- Value-based pricing aligned to government frameworks

**Product Pricing:**

- **Simple margin model**: Distributor cost + 10-15% markup
- Competitive with other panel vendors
- Volume discounts may reduce margin on large deals
- Bundled pricing (product + services) allows higher overall margin

### Cashflow Management

**Services:**

- Client pays Mokai (full contract value)
- Mokai pays contractors (after margin retention)
- Typical: Monthly invoicing, 14-30 day payment terms
- Commonwealth 20-day payment rule (contracts <$1M)

**Products:**

- **Critical timing issue**: May need to pay distributor before client pays Mokai
- Distributor credit terms: Net 30-60 days typically
- Client payment: Government 20-30 days, enterprise 30-60 days
- **Working capital requirement**: Bridge gap between distributor payment and client receipt

## Risk Management

### Business Risks

**Services Risks:**

- Contractor availability and quality
- Client payment timing vs contractor obligations
- Competition from established firms
- Technical capability gaps

**Product Reselling Risks:**

- **Distributor credit**: May require financial guarantees or prepayment initially
- **Working capital**: Paying distributor before client pays you
- **Pricing competition**: Other panel vendors may undercut on commodity products
- **Vendor relationship**: Loss of partnership status
- **Inventory risk**: If holding stock (though back-to-back model avoids this)

**Shared Risks:**

- Maintaining Indigenous business status
- Panel deregistration or loss of certification
- Cash flow management across both revenue streams

### Mitigation Strategies

**Services:**

- Robust contractor vetting and network
- Clear payment terms and working capital management
- Differentiation through Indigenous + quality positioning
- Continuous learning and network expansion

**Products:**

- **Start small**: Build distributor credit history gradually
- **Back-to-back model**: Don't hold inventory, fulfill on order
- **Working capital facility**: Invoice financing or line of credit for large deals
- **Bundle with services**: Harder to compete on price when bundled with implementation
- **Vendor diversification**: Multiple distributor relationships

**Shared:**

- Careful ownership structure maintenance (51%+ Indigenous)
- Strong financial controls and cash flow forecasting
- Maintain all certifications and panel registrations
- Regular compliance audits

### Insurance Coverage

- Professional indemnity insurance (services)
- **Product liability insurance** (for product reselling)
- Cyber liability insurance
- Public liability insurance
- Appropriate coverage levels for government work

---

## Government Panel Strategy

### Panel Types (Federal Government Example)

- **Professional Services Panel**: Cybersecurity consulting, GRC, IRAP
- **Software Panel**: Software licenses, SaaS subscriptions
- **Hardware Panel**: Cybersecurity hardware, endpoint protection

### Panel Status

- **Current**: Panels closed (as of transcript date), undergoing value-for-money review
- **Expected**: Panels will reopen, timeline TBD (Jack checking)
- **Competition**: 2,700 total vendors, only 66 are Indigenous businesses (across all categories)
- **Strategy**: Apply when panels reopen with Supply Nation certification complete

### Panel Benefits

- **Easier procurement**: Government can buy directly without full tender
- **Indigenous preference**: Weighted evaluation criteria favor Indigenous vendors
- **Visibility**: Listed in government vendor catalog
- **Volume**: Access to large government technology spend

---

## Key Financial Notes

### Payroll Tax Warning

- **Critical**: Payroll tax often forgotten in pricing
- **Threshold**: ~6% above certain revenue levels (varies by state)
- **Jack's advice**: "Always include it" even if under threshold
- **Impact**: Can "really fuck you" if you don't plan for it and exceed threshold
- **Action**: Include in all professional services pricing calculations

### Working Capital for Products

- **Issue**: May need to pay distributor Net-30 before client pays you
- **Solution options**:
    - Invoice financing (factoring)
    - Business line of credit
    - Distributor credit terms (build relationship)
    - Start with small orders to build credit history

### Tax Structure (Trust-Based)

- Revenue stage-based salary strategy:
    - $0-200K: Minimal/no salaries, keep cash in business
    - $200K-500K: Minimum salaries only
    - $500K+: Proper market-rate salaries
- Use trusts for tax-efficient dividend distribution
- Must pay SOME salary to avoid ATO scrutiny (can't be 100% dividends)

### IMPORTANT:

- ## Mokai Context Priority Rule

**Documents in `01-areas/business/mokai/context/` represent the current operational state and ALWAYS override older information when conflicts arise.**

### Conflict Resolution Priority (highest first):
1. **Context folder** (`01-areas/business/mokai/context/`) - Live operational updates
2. **Signed legal documents** (shareholder agreements, active contracts)
3. **Strategic/course materials** (foundational plans, may be outdated)
4. **Historical documents** (reference only)

### Within the context folder:
- Most recently dated/modified document takes precedence
- If dates are unclear, assume documents override in this order:
  - Operational updates (pricing, processes, partnerships)
  - Strategic updates (goals, positioning)
  - Background/explanatory documents

### When to flag conflicts:
If you notice a conflict between context documents and other materials that affects a decision, **mention it to the user** rather than silently choosing.
