Australian Government Cybersecurity Services Procurement: Landscape, Indigenous Policy, and Strategy for Mokai

Executive Summary

Diverse Procurement Models: Australian federal and state governments procure cybersecurity services through open tenders, mandated panel arrangements, and limited/direct sourcing. Open tenders (via AusTender) are the default for contracts over $80,000, while pre-approved panels (e.g. the Digital Marketplace panel and state ICT service schemes) enable faster engagement of vetted cyber suppliers.

Panels and Pre-Qualification: Panels are widely used for services like penetration testing, IRAP assessments, architecture reviews, and Essential Eight uplifts. For example, the federal Digital Marketplace panel includes a Cyber Security category and lets approved SMEs bid on government briefs. Many states have similar schemes (NSW’s ICT Services Scheme, SA’s eProjects Panel) that are often mandated for ICT/cyber purchases.

Limited Tender & Exemptions: Below threshold values, agencies frequently use limited tenders (select quotes) to quickly source cyber expertise. The Commonwealth Procurement Rules (CPRs) also allow exemptions to open competition, notably Exemption 16 for engaging an Indigenous SME (≥50% Indigenous-owned) directly, and Exemption 17 for directly sourcing any SME up to $500k after first considering Indigenous suppliers. These mechanisms streamline procurement for urgent or specialized cyber needs while still upholding value-for-money principles.

Procurement Challenges: Government cyber procurement faces unique challenges. The threat landscape evolves faster than procurement cycles, and agencies often lack in-house capacity, driving reliance on external providers. Ensuring value for money is tricky – it’s “difficult, if not impossible, to put a value on security” benefits. Audits show many entities struggle to enforce security requirements on vendors: over 70% of agencies had not fully implemented mandatory cyber controls (Top Four of the Essential Eight) by 2021, partly due to heavy outsourcing and limited control over provider practices.

Preferences & Trends: Governments prefer procurement avenues that balance speed, risk and accountability. There is a trend towards using pre-vetted suppliers and shorter engagements for cyber services, allowing agencies to plug skill gaps quickly. Larger or long-term managed cyber services might go to open tender for transparency and competition. Recent CPR updates mandate considering cyber risks in all contracts, so agencies now favor suppliers who meet security standards (e.g. holding security clearances, DISP membership for Defence, certified IRAP assessors, etc.). This alignment with frameworks (PSPF, ISM) means procurement decisions increasingly weigh a provider’s compliance and credentials alongside cost.

Frameworks Driving Demand: Government mandates like the ASD Essential Eight and the IRAP scheme significantly influence procurement choices. Federal entities are now required to implement the Essential Eight mitigations to a maturity level (Level 2 for a “Managing” security posture). Consequently, many agencies fund Essential Eight uplift programs and seek consultancy help for gap assessments and remediation. Similarly, systems handling sensitive data often must undergo IRAP assessments, leading agencies to regularly procure IRAP assessor services. (ASD recommends getting at least three quotes from certified IRAP assessors, ensuring competitive pricing and quality). In short, compliance deadlines and assurance frameworks are driving growth in service engagements – e.g. contracts for Essential Eight maturity audits, IRAP security assessments, and other consulting to meet the Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) requirements.

Indigenous Procurement Policy (IPP) Impact: The IPP is a powerful factor in federal procurement, including cyber services. Agencies have annual targets for contracting Indigenous businesses (e.g. 3% of contracts by number, with targets rising to 4% by 2029) and a Mandatory Set-Aside (MSA) for certain procurements. Under the MSA, any contract in a remote area or valued between $80k–$200k must first be offered to Indigenous SMEs that can deliver, before opening to the general market. This means a cyber consulting engagement in that range should be given to a capable Indigenous firm if available, aligning with the IPP’s value-for-money test. Agencies are even encouraged to extend this practice to smaller procurements (<$80k) to broaden Indigenous participation.

Using IPP/APP Pathways – Pros & Risks: For a firm like Mokai (an Indigenous-owned cyber consultancy), IPP/APP pathways can open doors to government work via simplified procurement. Benefit: Agencies can invoke CPR Exemption 16 to directly engage Mokai for a project of any size, bypassing lengthy tenders while contributing to their Indigenous spend targets. This provides Mokai a fast-track to contracts (especially for quick-turnaround needs like pen tests or IRAP assessments). Risk: These opportunities come with high scrutiny. There’s growing concern over “black cladding” – non-Indigenous entities using Indigenous fronts to win contracts. Genuine Indigenous businesses may face extra due diligence to prove capability and avoid perceptions of being a token partner. Mokai must demonstrate it’s not only Indigenous-owned on paper, but also technically competent and delivering value, to build confidence among procurement officers.

Maximizing IPP without Dependence: Mokai should leverage the IPP/APP as one part of its strategy, not the sole crutch. The strategic benefit of IPP set-asides and exemptions is getting initial contracts and references in a competitive market. It helps break into government panels and build past performance. However, long-term success requires standing on merit. Mokai should use IPP pathways to secure a foothold, then consistently deliver quality so that clients re-engage them for their expertise – even outside of special quotas. The goal is to be known first for capability, second for Indigenous ownership. This avoids over-reliance on preferential policies which could change or face tighter enforcement.

Tactical Playbook for Mokai: To capitalize on government procurement opportunities, Mokai needs to be proactive and prepared. Key steps include:

Market Positioning: Highlight both its unique status (Supply Nation registered, meeting IPP criteria) and its technical credentials (e.g. IRAP assessors on staff, CREST-certified testers, security clearances for team members). Emphasize understanding of government frameworks (Essential Eight, ISM, PSPF) – this builds trust that Mokai can navigate public-sector requirements.

Collateral and Compliance: Develop a strong Capability Statement – a 1-2 page company résumé outlining Mokai’s services, past project examples, team qualifications, and differentiators. Government buyers often scan capability statements to gauge fit. Include references to prior work (even smaller projects or private sector clients), methodologies (e.g. approach to penetration testing or incident response), and any quality accreditations (ISO 9001, ISO 27001, etc.). Ensure all necessary documentation is ready: up-to-date insurance certificates, work health & safety policies, security policies – procurement officers will ask for these in bids or during onboarding. Having a prepared “contractor pack” with these documents, plus resumes of key consultants, will streamline proposal writing and demonstrate professionalism.

Quality Assurance Processes: Outline Mokai’s QA steps for engagements (e.g. peer review of test results, rigorous reporting standards aligned to ASD guidelines, client sign-off procedures). Detailing a repeatable delivery process reassures agencies that a smaller firm can consistently meet outcomes. For example, describe how Mokai conducts an architecture security review: from initial scoping, threat modelling, to final report with actionable recommendations. This instills confidence in Mokai’s maturity and reliability.

Engagement Approach: When approaching procurement officers or pitching for work, focus on solving their problems. Research each agency’s cyber pain points – e.g., if an agency lags in Essential Eight compliance, discuss how Mokai can rapidly assess their gaps and uplift specific controls. Tailor capability statements or proposals to the agency’s context (cite Essential Eight or IRAP if relevant). Also, mention how engaging Mokai helps them meet policy goals (cyber resilience and Indigenous participation targets) without compromising quality – a win-win message.

Utilize Government Platforms: Make sure Mokai is listed on relevant procurement platforms: the federal Digital Marketplace (join the Digital Marketplace Panel so you can bid on ICT/cyber opportunities), state supplier portals (e.g. NSW ICT Services Scheme, VIC eServices Register, etc.), and Supply Nation’s Indigenous business directory. Many procurement officials start by searching these databases. Keep profiles up-to-date with services and case studies.

Networking and Visibility: Attend government procurement briefings, industry days, and AustCyber or ACSC events. These are chances to meet agency CISOs and procurement leads informally. Having a personal connection or name recognition can lead to invitation-only quotes (since limited tenders allow an agency to select who to request a quote from). Participate in forums and workshops (ACSC’s partnership programs, if any) to stay on radar.

Leverage Partners Cautiously: If certain tenders are beyond Mokai’s size (e.g. a large managed security services bid), consider partnering with bigger firms as a subcontractor to gain experience. However, ensure transparent and genuine partnerships. Avoid being a nominal Indigenous partner without substantive role (to dodge “black cladding” scrutiny). Formalize roles in writing and deliver visible parts of the project. This way, Mokai builds capabilities and past performance on larger projects, while the prime meets its Indigenous engagement goals – a mutual benefit.

Meet IPP/APP Obligations: Since Mokai is Indigenous-owned, maintain compliance to keep that status advantageous. This includes staying Supply Nation registered (and/or registered with any state Indigenous business directories) and, looking ahead, noting the tightening definition of an Indigenous business (from 50% to 51% ownership in 2026 to ensure majority control). Proactively report any required data to agencies on Indigenous participation when under contract (some contracts require quarterly reporting on Indigenous employment or subcontracting). By being a model IPP participant, Mokai will earn a good reputation.


Common Procurement Risks & Mitigations:

Scope Creep and Delivery Risk: Cyber projects can expand in scope (e.g. additional systems to test, new compliance requirements mid-stream). Mitigation: Define scope tightly in contracts and include buffer for unexpected work. Use change requests when scope alters, and communicate early with the client to reset expectations. Maintain an agile approach to prioritize critical outcomes if time or budget become constrained.

Capability Proof and Credibility: As a smaller or newer entrant, Mokai may face skepticism about its capacity to deliver complex engagements. Mitigation: Invest in staff training and certifications to bolster credentials. Present a strong track record through case studies. If lacking certain niche skills (e.g. forensic malware analysis), engage trusted independent contractors or advisors and include their credentials in proposals (a “bench” of experts). This shows the ability to scale expertise as needed. Starting with smaller contracts and excelling will build the performance history to win larger ones.

Compliance and Security Clearances: Government contracts often require compliance with security policies (ISM controls, background checks, possibly DISP membership for Defence work). Mitigation: Pre-empt these by adopting internal security policies aligned to ASD standards and obtaining baseline clearances for staff if possible. For any contract involving sensitive data, ensure team members have the requisite AGSVA security clearance or plan in advance for sponsorship. Demonstrating compliance readiness can be a deciding factor in award.

Administrative Overheads: Tendering and contract management can strain a small business. Complex paperwork, long payment cycles, and reporting duties (e.g. IPP reports, progress reports) are common. Mitigation: Streamline internal processes – maintain templates for proposals, risk management plans, and reports that meet government standards. Use accounting tools to handle invoicing and track payments; be aware of the federal Pay On-Time Policy which requires agencies to pay SME invoices within 20 days or pay interest. Don’t hesitate to follow up on late payments under this policy. Efficient back-office management frees up more time for service delivery.

Ethical and Reputational Risks: Procurement in the cyber domain may expose Mokai to sensitive information and ethical dilemmas (e.g. discovering serious security gaps or incidents). Mitigation: Adhere to strong ethical guidelines – protect confidentiality rigorously and disclose conflicts of interest (especially important in IRAP assessments – ASD requires assessors to declare conflicts). Build a reputation for integrity. This will reassure government clients and differentiate Mokai in a field where trust is paramount.

Policy Changes: Relying too much on set-asides can be risky if policies evolve. For instance, if future governments alter or taper Indigenous procurement quotas or SME preferences, a strategy solely hinged on those is vulnerable. Mitigation: Stay informed on policy changes (e.g. the IPP enhancements coming into effect 2025–2026). Diversify client base across federal, state, and even private sectors to buffer against policy shifts. Emphasize competitive strengths like specialized cyber expertise and client service, so Mokai wins work on open merit as well.

Contractual Risks: Ensure clarity on intellectual property (IP) ownership of deliverables, liability limitations, and insurance coverage when signing government contracts. Mitigation: Review contract terms carefully (engage legal advice if needed). Most panels use standard government contract templates – familiarize yourself with these in advance (e.g. the Digital Marketplace head agreement, NSW scheme contract terms). Having appropriate professional indemnity and liability insurance (often required in solicitations) with adequate coverage is essential; keep certificates ready for submission.



1. General Landscape (Australia) – Cybersecurity Procurement Practices and Drivers

Government procurement of cybersecurity services in Australia operates within the broader public procurement framework, but with nuances driven by the fast-changing cyber threat environment and compliance mandates. Federal and state agencies use a mix of procurement models to engage consultants for penetration testing, security architecture reviews, compliance audits (IRAP, Essential 8), managed security services, and more. The common procurement avenues include:

Open Tenders: A publicly advertised Approach to Market (ATM) on AusTender or state tender sites, open to all suppliers. This is required for contracts above certain thresholds (generally $80,000 for federal agencies) unless an exception applies. Open tenders ensure transparency and competition, often used for larger or multi-year cyber contracts – for example, a department seeking a 3-year managed SOC (Security Operations Centre) service or a whole-of-government security monitoring system would likely call an open tender. Evaluation in these cases focuses on detailed criteria (technical capability, methodology, experience, price, etc.) to achieve best value. While open tenders cast a wide net, they are slower to award, so they’re less common for urgent or highly specialized cyber tasks that need agility.

Panel Arrangements: Panels are pre-established lists of approved suppliers who have pre-qualified via a prior tender or application process. Both federal and state governments heavily utilize panels for ICT and cyber services. At the Commonwealth level, the Digital Marketplace Panel (originally the Digital Service Professionals panel) is a key mechanism – it’s a standing offer panel compliant with CPRs. Government buyers post “opportunities” on the Marketplace (e.g. a request for a penetration test or a security risk assessment) and panel sellers can respond with proposals. Only panel members can be approached for work, and for many ICT services this panel is mandatory for non-corporate Commonwealth entities to use. Panels streamline procurement by cutting down on repetitive due diligence – terms & conditions are agreed in advance and basic capabilities vetted, letting agencies engage suppliers quicker (sometimes with just a simplified request for quotes among panel members). Cybersecurity consulting often fits this model: an agency can solicit, say, three quotes from panel-listed cyber firms for an internal network penetration test, then pick the best value quote without a full open tender. Panel arrangements exist in states too: NSW’s ICT Services Scheme is a whole-of-government mandatory scheme for ICT procurement, which includes cyber services; South Australia’s eProjects Panel includes a dedicated Cyber Security Services stream for projects up to $700k. These panels underscore a procurement preference for efficiency – agencies tend to favor using an existing panel or cooperative procurement route if available, rather than start a fresh tender, to save time and effort.

Limited Tender (Direct Sourcing): In practice, many smaller or urgent cyber engagements are procured via limited tender – meaning the agency approaches one or a few selected providers directly for quotes. Below the formal tender threshold (e.g. under $80k federal, though entities have discretion up to $250k for certain consultancy panels), officials can justify a direct engagement if it represents value for money. For instance, during a cyber incident response, a government entity might directly engage an IRAP-assessed incident response firm under an emergency exception or approach a trusted panel firm to start work within days. The CPRs allow limited tender above thresholds only in specific cases (e.g. extreme urgency, sole supplier, or certain exemptions). Exemption mechanisms relevant to cyber include national security considerations (CPR Appendix A Exemption 13 allows certain procurements for intelligence agencies outside normal rules) and the small business/Indigenous SME exemptions (discussed in Section 2). Thus, if a cyber service is highly specialized (perhaps only one vendor has a particular forensic tool or decryption capability), an agency could invoke a CPR rule to do a limited tender citing technical reasons or urgency. In general, however, even when not formally required, agencies often seek at least a few competitive quotes to ensure value – a practice encouraged by guidance (for example, ASD advises seeking ≥3 quotes for IRAP assessor services to compare expertise and cost).


Current Challenges in Cyber Procurement: Procuring cybersecurity services is not a straightforward commodity buy; it comes with challenges on both the buyer and seller sides:

Keeping Pace with Threats vs. Process Timelines: The government’s procurement processes can be deliberative and slow, emphasizing probity and fairness. Cyber threats, by contrast, evolve rapidly. This mismatch can result in agencies feeling their contracting mechanisms are too sluggish or fragmented to respond to emerging needs. For example, by the time an open tender for a security monitoring service is completed (often months), the threat landscape or agency technology may have shifted. Agencies are addressing this by using more agile procurement models (panels, shorter contracts) and by pre-positioning capabilities (e.g. standing offers for incident response teams that can be activated immediately).

Value-for-Money vs. Quality Dilemma: Public procurement must achieve value for money – the CPRs’ core principle – yet evaluating the “value” of cybersecurity is inherently challenging. As one analysis notes, officials struggle because “it’s currently difficult, if not impossible, to put a value on security” outcomes. The cheapest bid may not equate to the best security outcome, but quantifying benefits of, say, a thorough security architecture review (which might prevent a breach that didn’t happen) is speculative. This often leads to a preference for trusted suppliers with a proven record, even if not the absolute lowest cost, and to multi-stage tenders where technical merit is weighted heavily. Nonetheless, procurement officers must justify selections rigorously, and this can disadvantage innovative smaller firms if they lack cost history or if risk-averse evaluators favor big names by default. There’s a growing recognition in government that procurement criteria for cyber need to consider past performance, skills, and even suppliers’ internal security (not just price), to truly get value – aligning with recommendations that procurement frameworks “provide commercial incentives for suppliers to improve their security” and even give preference to Australian companies for strategic capability.

Supply Chain and Vendor Security: Engaging external cyber providers introduces supply-chain risk – contractors often handle sensitive government data or systems. Notably, incidents have occurred where a contractor’s compromise led to security breaches in the client agency. The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) reported a significant increase in malicious activity targeting government contractors holding government information. In response, procurement rules were tightened: since 2020, agencies must assess and manage cyber risks in procurements. Policies like PSPF Policy 6 and 10 obligate agencies to include cybersecurity terms in contracts and ensure providers comply with mandatory controls. A challenge has been enforcement – an ANAO audit found agencies often did not monitor vendor compliance with security requirements post-contract. Thus, a current procurement preference is to choose providers who demonstrably adhere to high security standards (e.g. ISO 27001 certified, ASD partners, etc.), and include contractual clauses for security (right to audit, breach notification, etc.). It also means more contracts now ask bidders to detail their own cyber safeguards. From Mokai’s perspective, this is important: highlighting a strong internal security posture can be a differentiator.

Fragmentation and Skills Shortage: The demand for cyber services in government is high, but skilled providers (especially those with required clearances or IRAP accreditation) are limited. This supply constraint sometimes forces agencies into sole-source engagements or repeated use of a small pool of firms, which can drive up prices or strain those firms’ capacity. It’s a challenge to broaden the supplier base (particularly with the push to involve more SMEs and Indigenous businesses). One strategy has been the Digital Marketplace, deliberately lowering barriers for SMEs to bid on government digital work – as of Panel 2, hundreds of smaller companies including niche cyber startups are on the panel. This increased supplier diversity in theory; however, SMEs still report difficulties in competing, like lack of resources to write proposals or to get required certifications. The government is working on initiatives (like the 20% by value SME procurement target introduced in 2022) to stimulate small business participation. In cyber, this means agencies are encouraged to give SMEs a fair shot – e.g. running targeted RFQs on the marketplace restricted to SMEs, or carving out pieces of large projects that smaller specialists can deliver.

Frameworks and Compliance Influence: Australian Government cybersecurity frameworks heavily influence what services are procured. The Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) and ACSC’s Information Security Manual (ISM) set mandatory controls and maturity targets. For instance, since July 2022 all non-corporate Commonwealth entities are expected to implement the full Essential Eight strategies to mitigate cyber incidents, aiming for maturity level 2 (“Managing”). Many agencies were not at this maturity, so they have allocated budget specifically for Essential Eight uplift – often engaging consultants to perform maturity assessments, develop implementation roadmaps, and even hands-on keyboard to patch systems or deploy multi-factor authentication solutions. An example is the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission’s cyber uplift program to meet Essential 8 and PSPF requirements. Similarly, any agency moving systems to cloud or handling sensitive (PROTECTED or higher) information will require an IRAP assessment to certify the system against government security controls. Only ASD-endorsed IRAP assessors can do this work, which has led to a steady need to procure IRAP services across federal and state governments (e.g., cloud migrations, new system accreditations). The ACSC even publishes guidance for agencies procuring IRAP assessments, like suggesting a competitive quote process and adequate time for assessors. In short, as compliance deadlines loom (for example, meeting Essential 8 maturity by target dates), agencies lean on external expertise – driving procurement decisions and budget priorities directly tied to these frameworks. Providers who are well-versed in government standards or are part of the official programs (e.g. ASD Certified Consultants, or members of the Defence Industry Security Program (DISP) for Defence-related cyber work) have an edge in the procurement landscape.


Looking at procurement preferences, there’s a noticeable tilt toward contracts that deliver specific outcomes (e.g. a security audit report, an improvement in a maturity score) rather than just body-shopping personnel. Panels like the Digital Marketplace list categories by outcomes (strategy, assessment, etc.), not just labor rates. Governments prefer engagements where success can be measured against frameworks (did the agency get IRAP certified? did the Essential 8 maturity move from level 1 to 2? etc.). This outcomes focus benefits firms that can package their services as solutions. Also, risk considerations mean agencies might sometimes favor an Australian-owned provider or one with onshore data handling for certain sensitive tasks – aligning with supply-chain security concerns (for example, some tenders require contractors to store data in Australia and be cleared citizens, especially after high-profile data breaches). Sovereign capability is an emerging theme: giving local cyber industry a boost for resilience, which could advantage companies like Mokai that are Australian (and doubly so, Indigenous Australian-owned).

In summary, the Australian government’s procurement landscape for cybersecurity is shaped by a need for agility (hence panels and exemptions), a mandate for security (embedding Essential 8, IRAP, PSPF compliance into contracts), and policy pushes for SME and Indigenous participation. A company navigating this space must understand both the formal processes (tenders, panel bids) and the informal drivers (compliance trends, risk aversion, value-for-money calculus) to successfully win and deliver contracts.

2. IPP/APP Application – Indigenous Procurement Policy in Cyber Services

Australia’s commitment to Indigenous economic participation is manifest in procurement through the Indigenous Procurement Policy (IPP) at the federal level, and analogous Aboriginal Procurement Policies (APP) in various states. These frameworks directly impact how cybersecurity service contracts can be set up, especially for Indigenous-owned firms like Mokai. This section explains how IPP/APP mechanisms work in practice for cyber engagements and the unique opportunities and risks they create.

IPP Overview and Mechanisms: The Commonwealth’s IPP, launched in 2015 and administered by the NIAA, is a procurement-connected policy that obligates federal agencies (non-corporate Commonwealth entities, primarily) to pursue certain targets and practices when buying goods and services. The IPP has three core elements:

Annual Indigenous Contracting Targets: Each financial year, the government sets targets for the percentage of contracts (and a percentage of total contract value) to be awarded to Indigenous businesses. Initially, targets were around 3% of contracts; from 1 July 2025, the target for Commonwealth portfolios increases to 3% and will rise incrementally to 4% by 2029-30. These targets are not abstract – every Department and portfolio has a scorecard and reports performance. For example, the Department of Prime Minister & Cabinet proudly notes it “consistently exceeds the annual IPP targets” in its portfolio, reflecting a strong internal push to contract Indigenous suppliers. For agencies, failing to meet IPP targets can draw scrutiny, so there is real incentive to find Indigenous providers for projects, including in cybersecurity. This means if Mokai is available and capable, an agency might choose it over a non-Indigenous competitor to help meet their target provided value for money is comparable. Value for money remains paramount, but the IPP reframes the “value” equation to include broader economic participation benefits.

Mandatory Set-Aside (MSA): This is a crucial operational rule in the IPP that directly affects how procurements are conducted in certain scenarios. The MSA requires agencies to “offer Indigenous businesses the opportunity to demonstrate value for money” before going to open market for two categories of procurements: (a) those in remote areas, and (b) procurements valued between $80,000 and $200,000 (GST incl.). In practical terms, for any such procurement, the agency must first perform a market scan (often via Supply Nation’s database or their own knowledge) to see if there is an Indigenous business that could fulfill the requirement. If yes, they must at least approach one or more Indigenous suppliers and see if a deal can be made at a fair price. Only if no Indigenous enterprise is capable or available can they then proceed to a general tender or panel process. This set-aside is effectively a reservation of certain contract opportunities exclusively for Indigenous SMEs in the first instance. Application to cyber services: Many cyber consulting engagements fall in that $80k–$200k band (e.g. a $120k security audit, a $150k penetration test series, etc.). Under MSA, if Mokai offers such services, the agency must consider it (and any Indigenous competitors) before opening to others. This gives Mokai a first-mover advantage on a wide range of mid-sized projects. Note that even below $80k, agencies like PM&C encourage approaches to Indigenous SMEs to “broaden the scope” of the IPP set-aside – meaning there’s a cultural shift to include smaller procurements too, though not mandated by policy.

Mandatory Minimum Indigenous Participation Requirements (MMR): This aspect kicks in for high-value contracts (>$7.5 million) in certain sectors (initially sectors like construction, but expanding). It requires that if an Indigenous business doesn’t win the contract outright, the winning (non-Indigenous) contractor must meet minimum Indigenous participation goals (e.g. a percentage of sub-contracts or workforce). For instance, a major IT services contract above $7.5M might require the prime vendor to subcontract a portion to Indigenous businesses or employ Indigenous staff. While most pure cyber service contracts may not reach $7.5M, if Mokai ever partners under a prime contract of that scale, the MMR could ensure Mokai (or other Indigenous partners) get a share. It’s essentially a safety net ensuring large projects contribute to Indigenous economic development even if an Indigenous company isn’t the prime.


Exemption 16 (Direct Sourcing to Indigenous SMEs): One of the most powerful tools for agencies to implement the IPP is Exemption 16 of the Commonwealth Procurement Rules. This exemption explicitly allows a procurement of any value from a small or medium enterprise (SME) with at least 50% Indigenous ownership to be conducted via limited tender, bypassing the usual requirement for open competition. In other words, if Mokai (Supply Nation-certified as 50%+ Indigenous-owned) is deemed capable of delivering the needed cyber service, an agency can directly engage Mokai through a simpler quote/negotiation process – even if the contract value is well above the normal $80k threshold for open tenders. The Finance Department states this exemption “is intended to reduce the costs and administrative requirements for Indigenous SMEs”, making it easier for agencies to do business with them. For Mokai, this means a pathway to win sizeable contracts without the overhead of competing in a full tender against larger firms, as long as the agency is satisfied Mokai offers value for money. Agencies still typically compare prices or check past performance informally, but Exemption 16 removes a lot of formality. It’s often used in conjunction with the set-aside: e.g. for a $150k procurement in scope of MSA, an agency finds Mokai via Supply Nation, negotiates a proposal – if Mokai’s offer is reasonable, they invoke Exemption 16 to award it. Notably, agencies are being encouraged from the top to use this. PM&C’s own strategy mentions encouraging use of “CPR Appendix A Exemption 16 to facilitate limited tender approaches to Indigenous SMEs where appropriate”. This top-down encouragement aligns procurement officers with the idea that awarding directly to an Indigenous firm (when justified) is not only allowed but a positive outcome.

It’s important to mention Supply Nation here: Supply Nation is the leading directory of verified Indigenous businesses in Australia. Federal agencies typically require that an Indigenous supplier be listed in Supply Nation’s database to count towards IPP targets. Mokai should maintain this registration. Procurement officials use Supply Nation’s search tool heavily to find Indigenous suppliers by goods/services/category. In a cyber context, Mokai should ensure it’s listed under relevant service categories (e.g. “Cybersecurity consulting”, “IT security testing”) so that when someone searches, it appears. Also, some states have their own Indigenous business registers or accept Supply Nation – for example, the NSW Aboriginal Procurement Policy (which aims for at least 3% of contracts to Aboriginal businesses) works with an Aboriginal business register and has similar exemption provisions for direct negotiation. So Mokai’s presence and visibility in those channels is key to benefiting from IPP/APP.

How IPP/APP Applies to Cyber Engagements: Cybersecurity consulting is a professional service like any other, so no special carve-outs exclude it from IPP. If anything, it’s an area where agencies may actively seek Indigenous providers because it intersects two priority areas (cyber resilience and Indigenous opportunity). There are already a few Indigenous-owned IT security firms in the market (e.g. Willyama Services in Canberra, which has won sizeable government deals under IPP). Mokai can similarly leverage these policies. For instance:

An agency planning an Essential Eight maturity uplift project (say $200k to assess and remediate systems) falls under IPP’s MSA range. They identify Mokai as an Indigenous SME with cyber capability and might directly engage it under Exemption 16, or at least invite Mokai to quote under a limited approach. The agency meets a cyber need and checks a box towards their Indigenous spend target in one go.

For an IRAP assessment, agencies often use pre-existing panel arrangements due to the need for ASD-certified assessors. If Mokai attains IRAP assessor status (through staff accreditation) and is Indigenous-owned, it becomes very attractive: not only can it do the assessment, but the agency can claim it under IPP. Agencies could even justify using Mokai via Exemption 16 for an IRAP job to expedite scheduling an assessor, given the limited pool of IRAP assessors available (the exemption frees them from having to get multiple quotes if time is short, though ASD suggests getting quotes for cost efficiency).

For managed security services, like 24x7 monitoring, which tend to be larger contracts often awarded to big companies, IPP might influence subcontracting (MMR) or the inclusion of Indigenous SMEs in proposals. If Mokai cannot handle a 24x7 SOC alone due to scale, it might partner as a niche provider (maybe threat intelligence or training services) within a consortium to satisfy IPP requirements. The prime could cite Mokai’s role to fulfill an Indigenous participation plan which becomes mandatory if the contract value triggers MMR.


Risks and Scrutiny for Indigenous Businesses in Procurement: While IPP/APP open doors, Indigenous businesses in the cyber sector face heightened scrutiny and a few notable risks:

Capacity and Delivery Risk: Government stakeholders may (unfairly) question whether an Indigenous SME has the scale and technical depth to deliver critical cyber outcomes, especially if they are used to contracting large firms. There’s a risk that, if an IPP-engaged supplier underperforms, it could reinforce negative stereotypes or hesitance to use the IPP in the future. Mitigation is through capability proof – Mokai should continuously demonstrate competence (certifications, successful case studies) to build procurement officer confidence. Some agencies adopt a “partnership approach” to help new Indigenous vendors succeed: the ANAO noted that agencies most successful in IPP are those that get to know Indigenous businesses in their industry and help them compete and comply. Mokai should welcome such dialogue, seek feedback, and perhaps start with modest engagements to establish a track record.

“Black Cladding” and Integrity Concerns: Black cladding refers to unethical arrangements where a non-Indigenous company fronts as an Indigenous business (through a token owner or shell arrangement) to win contracts under IPP. This practice undermines the policy and has been met with zero tolerance by the government. Upcoming enhancements to the IPP explicitly focus on cracking down on black cladding – agencies will be under pressure to vet suppliers’ ownership bona fides and ensure the Indigenous business genuinely controls the enterprise. Additionally, from 2026 the criterion tightens to 51% Indigenous ownership (majority control) instead of 50%. Indigenous businesses like Mokai face the collateral effect of this scrutiny: they may be asked to provide proof of ownership, or there may be skepticism if, say, Mokai partners with a larger non-Indigenous firm as a subcontractor – procurement might probe “who is really doing the work?”. Transparency is key. Mokai should be prepared to articulate its structure (e.g. Indigenous founders, leadership roles) and be clear on the scope it will self-perform versus any subcontracting. Being seen as a capable prime in its own right, rather than a pass-through, is crucial to overcoming this risk.

Mandatory Paperwork and Compliance Burden: Ironically, benefiting from IPP can introduce extra contract management effort. For instance, if Mokai wins a contract via IPP, some agencies include clauses requiring quarterly reporting on Indigenous employment or supplier use during the contract. If Mokai itself is the contractor, usually this is straightforward (you’d report your workforce stats, etc.), but it’s an additional task to comply diligently. Failing to report or meet any promised Indigenous participation (if Mokai subcontracted further to other Indigenous businesses) could result in penalties or at least reputational harm. However, since Mokai is the Indigenous business, the main thing is to ensure any commitments made (like “we will use X% Indigenous personnel on this project”) are met and evidenced.

Exemption 16 Misuse Perception: There’s also a subtle risk on the agency side – if an agency repeatedly uses Exemption 16 to give work to an Indigenous firm without competition, internal or external auditors might question if it’s truly value for money each time. The ANAO found that 63% of contracts reported under the IPP from 2016–2024 were marked as “exempt” (i.e., likely via Exemption 16 or MSA), and some were using a vague “other” exemption reason. This high rate of exemptions has led to recommendations for tighter oversight. What this means for Mokai is that, while agencies can direct source it, they may still perform price benchmarking or require a robust quote to document the rationale. Mokai should always present competitive pricing and clear value propositions, so the procuring officer can defend the choice if ever scrutinized.

State-Level Variations: State governments have their own Indigenous procurement initiatives (often termed Aboriginal Procurement Policies). For example, New South Wales has an Aboriginal Procurement Policy that set targets (e.g. 3% of contracts to Aboriginal businesses by 2021) and includes similar set-aside principles for certain procurements. Western Australia and others have targets and compliance mechanisms (WA’s APP required 3% by number rising to 3% by value, etc., and has an annual reporting framework). While the specifics differ, any state agency Mokai engages will likely have some preferential procurement for Indigenous suppliers. Mokai should familiarize itself with each relevant state’s registration or certification (some states recognize Supply Nation; others might have additional local registries). In cyber services, state-level opportunities (e.g. a health department pen-test panel, or a Smart City cyber review for a local council) could leverage those APPs. The key is that the broader policy intent is uniform: increase Indigenous business participation. So whether federal or state, Mokai’s status is a positive differentiator – but it must be combined with strong delivery to truly capitalize on it.


In essence, IPP and APP create a favorable climate for Indigenous-owned cyber consultancies to win government work. They lower entry barriers (exemptions to usual tender rules) and actively channel contracts to such firms. For Mokai, the application of these policies means potential shortcuts to contracts that would otherwise be hard to win against larger incumbents. However, with opportunity comes responsibility: to use these pathways wisely, deliver on promises, and thereby reinforce the trust in procurement officers that engaging an Indigenous cyber firm yields excellent results and socio-economic benefits. By navigating the IPP/APP framework adeptly, Mokai can both contribute to and benefit from Australia’s aim of growing Indigenous representation in the cybersecurity sector.

3. Strategic Benefits and Practical Playbook for Mokai – Succeeding in Government Cyber Procurement

For Mokai, an Indigenous-owned small-to-mid-size cybersecurity consultancy, the Australian government market offers significant growth prospects – if approached with the right strategy. This section synthesizes the insights into a concrete playbook: how Mokai can leverage IPP/APP advantages without over-reliance, identify suitable programs and examples to learn from, and tactically prepare for engaging procurement officers and winning contracts. It also highlights common procurement risks Mokai should mitigate as it scales up in this sector.

Strategic Benefits of IPP/APP Pathways:

Easier Entry and Reduced Competition: As discussed, IPP provisions allow Mokai to be considered under set-aside or direct source conditions where normally dozens of competitors might vie. This dramatically improves win probability. For a young consultancy with few past contracts, skipping the crowded open tender stage is invaluable. It means Mokai can secure some initial government projects, build a portfolio and references, without having to beat the biggest firms in a head-to-head tender. Also, agencies have mandatory spend targets with Indigenous businesses. By awarding work to Mokai, they inch closer to those targets – this can make Mokai a preferred choice in borderline decisions. Essentially, Mokai offers a twofold value: quality cyber services plus progress on diversity goals. This dual appeal is a competitive edge not available to non-Indigenous rivals.

Relationship Building and Sole-Provider Roles: Direct sourcing opportunities (via Exemption 16 or MSA) let Mokai work more closely and iteratively with clients, rather than just responding to RFT documents. Mokai can meet with a department’s security team early, understand their needs deeply, and maybe pilot a small piece of work. If successful, that relationship can yield follow-on work (e.g. a series of security assessments each quarter, or an extended Essential 8 coaching engagement). Government buyers, once comfortable with a supplier, often prefer to stick with them for consistency – especially in cybersecurity where trust is paramount. By getting in the door through an IPP-facilitated contract, Mokai can entrench itself as a go-to advisor, making itself the natural choice for future tasks (even those that might go to open tender – the incumbent advantage is real).

Building Past Performance and Scale: Small consultancies often struggle to get their first few big contracts due to lack of past performance in government. IPP mitigates that catch-22. Each contract Mokai wins through these channels becomes a reference site and a capability proof-point. Over a few years, Mokai can accumulate enough government experience to be competitive in open tenders purely on merit. The goal is to use the stepping stones of IPP to reach parity with established players in terms of case studies and performance history. At that stage, Mokai won’t need to lean on its Indigenous status as heavily – it will be one of the established players (that also happens to help agencies meet IPP, a bonus). In other words, IPP can be seen as a business incubator for Mokai’s government portfolio, accelerating its maturation.

Sustainable Growth vs. Dependence: The question wisely points out not becoming dependent on these pathways. The risk of depending solely on set-asides is that one could plateau – only getting the small reserved contracts and never breaking into the mainstream (or worse, if policies change, losing the pipeline). Mokai’s strategy should be to treat IPP contracts as capability-building projects and invest revenue from them into strengthening the company (hiring more skilled staff, obtaining certifications, developing proprietary tools or IP). By reinvesting, Mokai increases its competitiveness for any contract, IPP or not. The strategic benefit then is not just revenue, but learning and improvement. For example, winning a contract to do a security architecture review for a government agency via direct sourcing gives Mokai insight into government architectures, standards, and expectations. Mokai can incorporate that knowledge to refine its methodologies, which then makes its proposals more compelling for other (non-IPP) clients. Over time, Mokai wants to position itself as the best value provider that just so happens to tick the IPP box – rather than winning only because of IPP.

Network and Reputation Advantages: There’s also an intangible benefit: being an Indigenous business in tech often comes with additional networking support. Organizations like AustCyber or the Indigenous Digital Excellence (IDX) initiative might have programs for Indigenous cyber entrepreneurs. Government agencies often host meet-the-supplier events specifically for Indigenous businesses to connect them with procurement staff. By participating, Mokai’s name becomes known. Goodwill is generally extended to those pursuing social procurement objectives – people want these suppliers to succeed (within the confines of still delivering outcomes). Thus, Mokai can cultivate champions or mentors in government more readily. In contrast, a generic small business might struggle to get the same attention. This supportive ecosystem is a strategic benefit that can help Mokai navigate bureaucracy with a bit more help.


Relevant Case Examples / Programs for SMEs:

Digital Marketplace Success: One example of a program favoring SMEs (including Indigenous SMEs) is the Digital Marketplace. It was designed to make it easier for smaller players to win work. According to the Digital Transformation Agency, a high percentage of Marketplace opportunities (well over 70%) have been awarded to SMEs since its inception, indicating it’s fertile ground for consultancies like Mokai. For instance, a small cyber firm from Melbourne reportedly won a series of brief contracts through the Marketplace to implement multi-factor authentication at a federal agency – each under $100k, which built up their credibility to later secure a larger ongoing contract. Mokai should actively pursue Marketplace briefs; even if some are small, they build experience and relationships.

Defence Industry Initiatives: If Mokai is interested in defence/national security sector work (which often involves cybersecurity consulting), the Defence Industry Security Program (DISP) is a program to enable SMEs to get the necessary security clearances and practices to work with Defence. While not a procurement panel per se, being DISP-accredited can open doors to defence contracts or subcontracts. There are also grants and support for SMEs in the defence sector (e.g. Defence Industry grants for capability development). A case example is Nova Systems (not Indigenous, but an SME) which grew via defence small projects and is now a prime; an Indigenous parallel is Willyama (Indigenous cyber firm) which won defence and Home Affairs contracts by building on DISP and cyber certifications. Mokai can draw lessons: invest early in any needed vetting (security clearances, DISP membership) if targeting those sensitive areas. It can be a unique selling point when competing with commercial firms that might not have clearances.

AustCyber Projects: AustCyber (now part of Innovate Australia) has in the past run industry development initiatives, like “Challenges” or co-funded projects with consortia of cyber SMEs tackling government-defined problems. Keeping an eye on such calls (for example, a state government might partner with AustCyber on an Essential 8 tool development project) could give Mokai a chance to participate in innovative pilots, which often come with government connections and showcase opportunities.

State Government Panels: Being on state ICT/cyber panels (like the NSW ICT Services Scheme, VIC eServices, SA eProjects) is important for an SME to capture state-level work. For example, a small Queensland security firm entered the Queensland Government market via the QITC panel and won a contract to conduct cybersecurity awareness training across a department. That gave them exposure and led to further contracts in policy development. Mokai should similarly register for or pre-qualify on any panel where cyber services are procured. Many of these have rolling admission or EOI processes (NSW ICT Scheme is continuously open for new suppliers). It’s worth the administrative effort because once on, Mokai can be directly invited for quotes by any agency in that jurisdiction.

Mentor-Protégé or Partner Programs: While not as formalized in Australia as the US 8(a) or HUBZone programs, informally some larger system integrators take Indigenous businesses under their wing (especially to meet their own IPP MMR obligations on big projects). For instance, IBM Australia has publicly committed to partnering with Indigenous tech businesses and has subcontracted work to them on government projects. Mokai might identify a few strategic big companies and build relationships (perhaps via Supply Nation business events) so that when those companies pursue big government tenders, Mokai can be written in as the cyber specialist Indigenous partner. This way Mokai gains experience on large-scale projects it couldn’t prime right now (e.g. a $5M whole-of-department cyber uplift led by a big4 consultancy could include a $300k work package for Mokai to handle vulnerability assessments). Over time, this can convert to Mokai leading smaller contracts independently with references from the big project.


In terms of a Practical Playbook for Mokai, the following steps summarize how to position and prepare for government procurement success:

1. Get Certified and Visible: Ensure Mokai is Supply Nation registered (and keep that updated with any changes in ownership or structure). Explore state Indigenous business certifications if needed (e.g. NSW requires confirmation of Aboriginal ownership through an independent process for their APP – often Supply Nation is enough, but double-check). Join the Digital Marketplace Panel (if not already) by applying through the DTA – this gives access to federal opportunities. List on relevant panel schemes (this may require some paperwork about financial viability, insurances, etc., so assemble those documents). Basically, remove any barriers for a procurement officer trying to find or engage Mokai. We want Mokai’s name popping up in all the right searches and lists.


2. Develop Core Marketing Material: The Capability Statement is vital. It should concisely cover: company overview (Indigenous ownership, mission), services offered (penetration testing, IRAP assessments, Essential 8 consulting, etc.), past performance (even if not gov – private sector projects or team members’ prior experience), and contact info. Keep it factual and outcomes-focused (e.g. “Performed 10+ penetration tests in finance and government sectors, identifying critical vulnerabilities and improving clients’ security posture by aligning with ASD Essential Eight controls.”). Also mention any quality standards (methodologies follow ASD’s ISM guidelines, etc.) to show alignment with gov expectations. Mokai should also prepare a one-page Indigenous Engagement fact sheet – basically highlighting Mokai’s story (founder background, community links) and how hiring Mokai supports Indigenous advancement. This isn’t just fluff; procurement officers might include such a blurb in their submission to delegate to justify an IPP procurement. Make it easy for them to say “by selecting Mokai, we are supporting the IPP’s goals of Indigenous entrepreneurship and contributing to economic outcomes for First Nations peoples” – essentially giving them the ammo to defend the decision.


3. Strengthen Internal Processes: Before big contracts come, have the house in order. That means documented processes for deliverables (checklists for pen test execution, report templates that look polished and meet government standards), a Quality Assurance (QA) plan (maybe an internal senior consultant or external peer will review all major deliverables before client handoff), and a risk management approach (including how Mokai secures any sensitive data it handles from clients). Government clients often ask in tenders about quality management – being able to say “Mokai has a QA process and uses industry best practices (e.g., OWASP for web app testing, NIST frameworks for risk assessments)” adds credibility. Also ensure compliance with any likely contract provisions: for example, the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) might apply if personal data is involved, so Mokai should be ready to handle data according to those principles.


4. Prepare Standard Docs: Have a ready pack for common requirements: resumes of key personnel (tailored to highlight their government or relevant experience), copies of any certifications (e.g. CISSP, CREST, OSCP of staff), insurance certificates (public liability, professional indemnity – government typically requires around $10M coverage for PL and PI; Mokai should maintain at least that to qualify for most work). Also, a template project plan and reporting format, as sometimes proposals ask for those. The more that’s pre-prepared, the quicker Mokai can turn around high-quality responses to opportunities (speed can be decisive, especially on Marketplace briefs that might only be open a week).


5. Engage Early and Educate Procurement Officers: When possible, meet with agency contacts before a need is formalized. This could be at industry info sessions or by requesting a capability presentation meeting. Use those to educate them on Mokai’s capabilities and also how engaging Mokai through IPP works. Surprisingly, some procurement staff (especially at divisions far from central procurement hubs) may not be fully fluent in using Exemption 16 or might be nervous about it. Mokai can gently advocate: “Did you know you can procure from us directly since we are Indigenous-owned? We can help draft a value-for-money justification if needed.” This proactive stance can alleviate any hesitancy. It’s essentially helping them help you. One must do this tactfully, of course, focusing on how it simplifies their life and achieves outcomes faster.


6. Deliver Excellence and Gather Testimonials: Once work is won, execution is key. Aim to exceed expectations on the first few contracts – this could be by delivering ahead of schedule, finding extra issues that improve security, or transferring knowledge to the client’s team (so they feel they got capacity building too). Happy clients are often willing to serve as referees or give a short testimonial. Ask for a letter of appreciation or an email that can be later cited in proposals. Future tender responses can then quote, for example, “Agency X CISO noted Mokai’s pen test report was the most thorough they had received, helping them remediate issues swiftly”. Such references build trust with new clients.


7. Scale Thoughtfully: As Mokai grows via government work, scale up in a controlled manner. It’s tempting to chase many opportunities, but ensuring each contract is delivered well is more important for long-term success. Government networks share information; a single project failure can tarnish reputation widely, while a strong success can be a springboard. Consider focusing on a few key domains initially (e.g. become the go-to for Essential Eight guidance or the best at cloud security assessments) rather than trying to do all things at once. Specialization can be a market entry strategy – win on niche expertise, then broaden out.


8. Risk Mitigation Strategies: We already discussed common risks and how to handle them (scope, compliance, etc.), but as part of the playbook, Mokai should maintain a risk register for its contracts. Government projects might entail specific risks like access to systems (clearances needed), or tight deadlines tied to fiscal year (needing proper resource allocation). By identifying these and planning mitigations (e.g. have standby subcontractors, use project management tools to track tasks), Mokai can avoid common pitfalls that SMEs face, such as overcommitting or missing deadlines.



In addition, maintaining financial health is critical. Government payments can be slow (though they aim to pay SMEs within 20 days, it can slip). Mokai must ensure it has enough cash flow to pay staff and expenses while awaiting payments. One tactic is to negotiate payment schedules in contracts (for example, a portion on draft report delivery, not 100% on final, to improve cash flow). Don’t hesitate to utilize the government’s SME friendly policies like requesting faster payment or using supply chain finance options if offered.

Procurement Officer Engagement: It deserves emphasis how to approach procurement officers specifically. These officials are gatekeepers and facilitators. Mokai should treat interactions with them professionally and helpfully. Always respect formal processes (e.g., if a tender is open, don’t breach probity by trying to lobby outside the Q&A). But outside of tenders, they can be your advisors. Many will gladly explain how their agency buys services if asked. Questions like “Are there any upcoming cyber panels or refreshes we should know about?” or “How does your agency typically procure pen testing – via panel, or do you do open RFQs?” can yield valuable intel. It shows you are serious about working with them on their terms.

When submitting any quote or tender, make the procurement officer’s job easy: follow the requested format, be clear and concise, and address all criteria. Use their terminology (if the RFQ says “provide a plan for incident response”, title your section “Incident Response Plan” and provide exactly that). These sounds like basics, but many bidders fail on them, and a small business that nails compliance with requirements will stand out for professionalism. Procurement folks appreciate not having to chase you for missing info.

Finally, always demonstrate Value for Money (VfM) in proposals. This doesn’t mean cheapest price; it means clearly tie your solution to outcomes and benefits. Government evaluators often use a VfM formula that considers quality and cost. Mokai should articulate the tangible benefits (reduced risk, compliance achieved, user awareness raised, etc.) of its work. If your price is higher than a competitor’s, justify it with value-add (maybe your team has an extra reviewer for quality, or you include a training session for staff – highlight those). Since Mokai also contributes to socio-economic goals, subtly mention that too: e.g. “Engaging Mokai also delivers social value by building Indigenous cyber capability in line with government policy – an additional value-for-money consideration.” This reminds evaluators that there is a broader benefit, which can sometimes tip a decision when technical scores are close.

To conclude this playbook: Mokai’s aim is to be strategic – use every advantage at its disposal (policy, networks, expertise) but also prepare as if those advantages didn’t exist. That way, if IPP/APP preferences vanished tomorrow, Mokai would still be a strong competitor due to its track record and capabilities. By delivering excellent cybersecurity outcomes to its government clients, Mokai not only secures repeat business but also advances the narrative that Indigenous businesses are integral to Australia’s tech sector – feeding back into the supportive environment that helped it start. With this comprehensive approach, Mokai can grow from winning its first small government contract to becoming a respected provider on par with much larger firms, all while retaining the agility and community-focused ethos that define its core.
