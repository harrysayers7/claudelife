# Competitive Landscape: Indigenous Cybersecurity Consulting in Australian Government

## Executive Summary

Australian government agencies are increasingly prioritizing partnerships with Indigenous-owned cybersecurity firms, creating a dynamic competitive landscape. There are only a handful of 100% Indigenous-owned cyber consultancies – notably Baidam Solutions, Willyama Services, Secure State, Arrpwere Cyber, Intaris (formerly Yira Yarkiny in WA), Patonga Projects, Binary Security, among others – but they are rapidly making their mark. These firms differentiate through Indigenous heritage and social impact programs while delivering services like Essential Eight maturity uplift, IRAP assessments, penetration testing, and strategic cyber advisory. Many hold Supply Nation certification and are on government panels or procurement lists, giving them preferred status under the Indigenous Procurement Policy (IPP). For example, Baidam Solutions (based in Brisbane) has built Australia’s first Indigenous-run Security Operations Centre (SOC) and claims over 1,100 government engagements delivered, leveraging its Supply Nation certification to help agencies meet IPP targets. Willyama Services (headquartered in Canberra) similarly positions itself as “Australia’s only 100% Indigenous-owned and operated cyber security services firm” with cleared staff and a track record across Federal and State governments.

Direct Indigenous competitors are generally small (often <50 staff) but punch above their weight via strategic partnerships and panel placements. Baidam and Willyama lead this segment in visibility and contract wins – Baidam invests 50% of profits into training Indigenous talent and has formed alliances with global tech vendors (e.g. Google, Infoblox) to broaden capabilities. Others like Secure State (Adelaide-based, focused on defense industry needs) and Intaris (Perth-based, targeting critical infrastructure) carve out niches by combining cultural values with specialized services (e.g. Secure State is a CMMC Registered Provider for defense suppliers, Intaris blends Indigenous ownership with national cyber leadership for WA clients). Arrpwere and Patonga Projects integrate cyber services into broader IT consulting, often partnering with larger integrators to deliver projects and meet IPP obligations.

Beyond the Indigenous segment, Mokai faces two major competitor groups: (1) Boutique cybersecurity consultancies (non-Indigenous) and (2) Global firms (Big 4 and large integrators). In the boutique arena, companies like Phronesis Security, Ionize, Gridware, Shearwater (now part of CyberCX), and Sekuro (among others) compete for government contracts by touting deep technical expertise or agile delivery. For instance, Phronesis Security (Melbourne/Canberra) emphasizes its social enterprise ethos (“Cyber Security For Good”) and has IRAP assessors and CREST-certified testers on staff. These boutiques (typically <100 staff) often excel in specialized domains – e.g. penetration testing, IRAP accreditation, Essential Eight compliance – and are known to undercut larger firms on price while delivering faster turnarounds. Many have strong reputations in the Australian Information Security Association (AISA) community, having won industry awards (Phronesis won **“Cyber SMB of the Year 2024”**) or securing marquee government clients like the Department of Defence and state agencies. Government buyers turn to these mid-tier consultancies for their technical depth and focus: e.g. Ionize (Canberra) is renowned for penetration testing and ASD Top 37 controls compliance, Enosys and Retrospect Labs specialize in incident response and cyber exercises, etc. The key differentiators among boutiques include niche specialization (OT/SCADA security, governance/risk vs. offensive security), flexibility and client intimacy, and often mid-range pricing. However, none can offer the breadth of services or nationwide scale that bigger firms do, and most lack Indigenous status, which can be a vulnerability when IPP rules apply.

The Big 4 consultancies (Deloitte, PwC, EY, KPMG) and large defense integrators remain formidable but have specific strengths and weaknesses. They dominate strategic cybersecurity projects – multi-million dollar strategy development, large-scale transformation programs, or whole-of-government security uplift – thanks to their brand reputation and vast resources. Big 4 firms maintain panels and preferred supplier status across federal departments (especially in Canberra) and are often the default for high-level advisory. For example, McKinsey (though not Big 4, a global consultancy) was recently paid $2.4M by Home Affairs to support Australia’s Cyber Security Strategy development, illustrating the government’s willingness to invest heavily in big-name consultants for critical initiatives. Similarly, Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG have each built sizable federal cyber practices led by ex-government security leaders. They often provide IRAP assessments, governance frameworks, and “strategic roadmap” consulting at premium rates. Where Big 4 excel: broad coverage of services (from risk advisory to technical cyber defense), ability to marshal large teams quickly, and perceived low risk for agency decision-makers (choosing a Big 4 can be seen as a “safe” option). However, these firms are typically far more expensive and sometimes less agile: their day rates for senior cyber consultants often exceed $2,000/day, and partners can be billed much higher (compared to ~$1,000–$1,400/day typical in boutique firms). Moreover, Big 4 firms lack Indigenous ownership, so to comply with IPP requirements they either subcontract to Indigenous SMEs or, in one notable model, create joint ventures (e.g. PwC’s Indigenous Consulting, now Yamagigu under Deloitte). These partnership vehicles allow Big 4 to claim partial Indigenous status and win set-aside work (PwC’s Indigenous Consulting garnered $7.2M in contracts within a few years by leveraging this model). Still, on smaller engagements where price and agility matter, and where an Indigenous vendor is available, Big 4 can be beaten. Mokai’s opportunity against Big 4 lies in targeting those “mid-tier” projects (e.g. under $1M) where a nimble, value-for-money approach plus the Indigenous supplier preference gives Mokai a distinctive edge. Government clients frustrated with Big 4’s high costs or generic solutions may welcome a specialized Indigenous firm that delivers more hands-on technical expertise and faster turnaround.

Individual contractors and micro-consultancies also populate this market – especially IRAP assessors operating as freelancers or small shops. The ASD’s IRAP directory lists dozens of qualified assessors, many of whom contract directly to agencies or through labor-hire arrangements for specific security assessment tasks. These individuals (often ex-Defense or ex-consulting veterans) can command high daily rates (in the $1200–$1600+ per day range for IRAP assessments) due to the scarcity of their certification. Agencies sometimes prefer hiring a sole assessor (or a small team of contractors) for flexibility or confidentiality – for example, a classified system accreditation might engage an independent IRAP assessor on a short contract rather than a big firm. However, relying on individuals has downsides: capacity is limited to that person’s availability, and if problems arise, the agency has little recourse or breadth of support. Mokai can position against one-person competitors by highlighting team scalability and assurance – i.e. a bench of cleared consultants backing each engagement, robust QA processes, and continuity of service (if one person is unavailable, the firm can substitute another, etc.). Moreover, Mokai’s status as an organization (with insurances, governance, etc.) gives government more confidence in accountability compared to a sole trader. Still, freelancers remain competition especially on price-sensitive bids – they have low overhead and often undercut firms. Mokai should thus emphasize the value (not just price) of getting a team’s collective knowledge and support, plus its Indigenous ownership which sole traders usually cannot match unless they themselves are Indigenous (some are, but they may not have formal Supply Nation certification or panel presence).

Overall, the Australian government cybersecurity procurement landscape in 2025 is highly competitive but also full of opportunity for a new Indigenous entrant like Mokai. Demand for cybersecurity services is growing across Federal and State agencies, and policy trends (IPP, Buy Australian, SME participation targets) favor firms like Mokai that are local, agile, and Indigenous-owned. Government tenders vary in competitiveness: open tenders often attract 5–10 bidders on average for specialist cyber projects, though many smaller procurements use restricted panels or pre-qualified lists which keep competition to a handful of known suppliers. Incumbency provides an advantage (agencies tend to re-engage known performers), but switching does occur when either an incumbent underperforms or policy directives (e.g. requiring an Indigenous supplier or better value) encourage looking elsewhere. Notably, as of 2024, around **45% of federal contracts by value are still awarded via limited tender (sole-source or select)** – relationships and pre-positioning matter. Yet, new entrants can break in: according to a 2024 survey, many tech SMEs report lengthy sales cycles but eventual success if they persist and demonstrate value. Price vs. value in tenders depends on the procurement method: for simple services and commoditized skills, lowest-price compliant bids often win (or an LPTA – Lowest Price Technically Acceptable – approach is used). But for most cybersecurity consulting, “value for money” evaluation is standard, meaning a balanced score between capability and cost. This means Mokai must be competitive in pricing but not necessarily the absolute lowest – demonstrating superior value (technical excellence, faster delivery, Indigenous social outcomes, etc.) can justify a moderate price premium. Government evaluators will pay more if convinced of better outcomes or reduced risk. The day rate benchmarks in this market range roughly from $800–$1,100 for mid-level cyber consultants and pen testers, up to $1,300–$1,600 for highly specialized or senior roles. Mokai should aim to price in that mid-range – undercut Big 4 significantly, stay on par or slightly below top boutique rates – while highlighting the additional 5-10% “bonus value” agencies get via Indigenous procurement credit toward their targets.

In summary, Mokai’s competitive position can be strong if it leverages its unique qualities:

Indigenous ownership: a differentiator that yields not just IPP preference but a compelling story of social impact and diversity (following the path of Baidam and Willyama’s success in turning cultural heritage into business value).

Focused expertise and agility: unlike conglomerates, Mokai can specialize (e.g. be the Essential Eight compliance expert or the nimblest IRAP-ready team), delivering faster and more flexibly.

Partnerships: teaming up with larger players (even competitors) to fulfill subcontractor roles can be a win-win – e.g. Big 4 firms often need Indigenous partners for bids, and non-Indigenous boutiques might subcontract to Mokai to meet client diversity requirements. These collaborations can provide revenue and past performance while still allowing Mokai to grow its own client base.

Competitive pricing with value focus: by maintaining lean operations, Mokai can offer rates in the lower-middle of market range, and combine that with high-quality deliverables to present best value. For instance, Mokai could charge ~$1,000/day for an Essential Eight consultant (market mid-range) and highlight that this comes with Indigenous participation and senior oversight included, making it better value than a solo freelancer or an inflated big-firm quote.


Key Threats: Mokai must watch out for entrenched incumbents (some agencies have long-running contracts with certain boutiques or Big 4 – breaking those ties requires a strong reason) and black-cladding or partnerships that dilute its edge. If a non-Indigenous firm pairs with a smaller Indigenous company (or presents a “token” Indigenous team member) to claim IPP compliance, Mokai’s advantage could be neutralized in that bid – thus, Mokai should emphasize its 100% Indigenous ownership and genuine community investment to distinguish from superficial efforts. Additionally, capability gaps need addressing: where competitors boast special certifications (e.g. CREST for penetration testing, multiple IRAP assessors, ISO27001 Lead Auditors, etc.), Mokai should strive to attain similar credentials or bring on advisors/contractors with them, to avoid being seen as less qualified.

Winning Strategy: To win contracts consistently, Mokai should target under-served segments where competition is weaker or where it has a natural advantage. Potential sweet spots include:

Essential Eight and cyber maturity roadmaps for smaller agencies or local government – many big players overlook smaller contracts (<$200k) here, and few Indigenous firms are playing in this space yet. Mokai could become known as the go-to for Essential Eight uplift.

Rapid deployment engagements – government clients often have urgent needs (short-term expert secondments, incident response support). Mokai’s agility and network of cleared consultants could beat slow-moving larger firms when speed is critical.

Emerging tech security – areas like cloud security automation, AI security assessments, or OT security have talent shortages. If Mokai develops a niche offering (for example, an AI-risk assessment service or an ICS/OT security health check), it can stand out as one of the few suppliers in that niche.

Alliance with larger primes – proactively approach Big 4 or major IT vendors to be their preferred Indigenous subcontractor for cybersecurity. This turns some competitors into channels for Mokai (many Big 4 already look for such partners due to IPP; Mokai can pitch itself as a credible, quality option).


In conclusion, the competitive landscape is favorable for Mokai if navigated strategically. The market is growing, policy tailwinds support Indigenous businesses, and several incumbent competitors have exploitable weaknesses (whether it be high pricing, narrow focus, or lack of authenticity in Indigenous engagement). By understanding each competitor’s positioning and tailoring its approach accordingly (see detailed profiles and matrix below), Mokai can secure a strong foothold and even take market share from both direct Indigenous rivals and non-Indigenous firms. The following sections map out the competitors in detail, provide intelligence on their pricing and track records, and recommend concrete tactics for Mokai to win against each type.

Competitor Matrix

Below is a high-level matrix of key competitors, segmented by type, with their positioning and how Mokai can stack up against them:

1. Baidam Solutions – Indigenous Cybersecurity Firm

Overview: Brisbane-based, Supply Nation certified. ~20–30 staff plus contractors. First Nations owned (since 2018). On multiple government panels (federal and QLD).

Services: Broad cyber services and product resale. Offers network & application security, SOC-as-a-service, Essential Eight consulting, training. Prominent for running an Indigenous-manned 24/7 SOC.

Track Record: Strong – claims 1100+ government contracts delivered (likely many small procurement transactions). Known clients include federal departments and large corporates via RAP programs. AusTender shows numerous contracts (e.g. Department of Defence consultancy contracts). Often wins work via sole-source under IPP and as subcontractor on large projects.

Pricing: Mid to high-mid. Not public, but likely standard consulting day rates (~$1000–$1400). As a product reseller, sometimes competes on margin rather than day rate. Market sees them as fairly priced, not bargain.

Strengths: Exceptional Indigenous branding and social impact narrative (50% profit reinvestment in training). Partnerships with top vendors (Google, Infoblox). Only Indigenous firm with a SOC capability (unique offering). Good mix of services and reseller arrangements makes them a one-stop shop for some clients.

Weaknesses: Rapid growth could strain quality/control. Diversification into product sales means focus might be split. Some tech areas may rely on partners (for instance, their SOC had to be co-built with White Rook and Tarian Cyber). If a client only wants pure consulting (no need for SOC or products), Baidam might not appear much different than any other consultancy except for Indigenous status.

Mokai’s Advantage vs Baidam: Mokai can specialize more deeply in areas Baidam only lightly touches – e.g. if Baidam is busy with SOC and product distribution, Mokai could become known as the expert team for IRAP or for high-end penetration testing (capabilities Baidam has but not as core focus). Also, Baidam’s success means they may be seen as less hungry/flexible – Mokai as a newcomer can be more responsive and price-flexible to win initial contracts. Mokai shares the Indigenous status (neutralizing Baidam’s key differentiator), so competing will come down to technical merit and cost, where Mokai can win if it demonstrates superior expertise or agility in delivery.

Threat Level to Mokai: High. As a pioneer Indigenous cyber firm, Baidam will often be Mokai’s direct rival on opportunities seeking an Indigenous supplier. Mokai should expect Baidam to be its primary competitor in federal tenders with IPP weighting.


2. Willyama Services – Indigenous Cybersecurity/IT Firm

Overview: Canberra-headquartered, 100% Indigenous-owned (founded 2016). ~40+ employees. Supply Nation certified. On Federal Government ICT panels and various defense contracts (Willyama launched a dedicated cyber business in 2022 in Canberra).

Services: Broad ICT consulting plus cybersecurity. Services include governance/risk (they have ex-Defense consultants), secure infrastructure, project management, and some cyber product resale. Emphasizes being experienced in classified government work (NV1/ NV2 cleared staff). Likely offers IRAP assessments (founder Kieran Hynes has defense background).

Track Record: One of the earliest Indigenous IT providers to Federal Govt. Has delivered projects for Dept of Defence, Home Affairs, and NSW Government (per website claims). AusTender shows contracts e.g. for “cyber framework development” and labor hire roles. Known to have a panel spot on the Department of Defence ICT Provider Arrangement. Solid reputation in defense circles.

Pricing: Mid-range. Likely around $1000/day for consultants. Competes on value of Indigenous status + quality. Not seen as cheap, but generally competitive against mid-tier firms.

Strengths: Strong leadership credibility (ex-military founder, gives assurance in gov sector). Proven track record with complex government requirements – they highlight “trusted to work in highly classified environments”. Also a focus on employing Indigenous veterans and staff, aligning with government social procurement goals. Their longevity means references/case studies exist (which newer firms lack).

Weaknesses: Service portfolio is broad, not purely cyber – could be seen as “jack of all trades” compared to specialist firms. Being Canberra-centric, they may have less presence in states like NSW/Vic unless through remote delivery. Growth ambitions (“largest Indigenous professional services company” vision) could make them chase projects outside core competency.

Mokai’s Advantage vs Willyama: Mokai can position as more specialized in cybersecurity (if Mokai sticks strictly to cyber, whereas Willyama does general ICT as well). Also, Mokai being newer might adopt latest methodologies and tools (whereas Willyama’s approach might be a bit traditional consulting). In competitive bids, Mokai can underscore a laser focus on cyber outcomes (vs Willyama’s broader IT consulting angle) and potentially come in at a sharper price point (Willyama’s established nature might come with higher overheads).

Threat Level: High (direct competitor). Willyama will be a contender on many Indigenous set-aside or IPP-weighted opportunities, especially in federal and defense markets. They have incumbency in some panel arrangements that Mokai will need to break into.


3. Secure State – Indigenous Cyber Firm (Defence-focused)

Overview: Adelaide-based, Indigenous-owned cybersecurity consultancy (often described as a “sovereign Indigenous cyber business”). Likely small (<20 staff). Focuses on defense industry and SMEs in defense supply chain.

Services: Specializations include Defence compliance (DISP accreditation support), CMMC (US DoD Cybersecurity Maturity Model) consulting – they tout being Australia’s leading CMMC partner. Also Essential Eight uplift, ISO 27001 implementation, and managed security services for defense suppliers. Possibly some custom secure cloud product (mentioned “xClave sovereign cloud” on their profile).

Track Record: Has won work with Defence SA and presumably contracts with defense primes or Australian Defence Force projects (given their niche). They joined an archTIS partner program to deliver defense-grade solutions. Not widely known outside defense circles, but within that niche they’re considered experts. Likely on the Defence Support Services panel or similar.

Pricing: Niche consulting usually commands higher rates. Likely mid-high (maybe $1200/day range due to specialized compliance consulting). Defense projects often pay premium for compliance consulting.

Strengths: Clear niche focus – by specializing, they have deep credibility in defense cybersecurity (CMMC, DISP are complex areas). Being Indigenous-owned gives them a double benefit when defense contracts combine sovereign capability and IPP goals. Small but highly focused team can deliver personalized service to clients in that segment.

Weaknesses: Outside of defense/defense-supply-chain, their brand is not prominent. They may not have experience in broader commercial or civilian government domains. The narrow focus limits their addressable market (e.g. an agency wanting O365 security consulting might not consider them). Also, being Adelaide-based might limit recruitment of talent or reaching East Coast clients (though remote work mitigates that somewhat).

Mokai’s Advantage: If Mokai is not targeting defense exclusively, it can avoid head-to-head with Secure State. However, if opportunities arise in defense, Mokai might emphasize a broader service suite (e.g. “we do CMMC plus other security services, so the client gets more value in one supplier”). Mokai could also differentiate by location and responsiveness (e.g. having presence in Canberra/Sydney to support defense clients on-site, whereas Secure State is SA-based). Team size could be an advantage if Mokai grows bigger than Secure State, offering more capacity.

Threat Level: Medium. Secure State is a direct Indigenous competitor but confined to a specific corner of the market. Mokai should monitor them for any expansion beyond defense (if they start targeting general government contracts, then threat rises).


4. Arrpwere Cyber – Indigenous IT & Cyber Group

Overview: Canberra-based group (“Arrpwere”) with divisions for Consulting, Cyber, and People. 100% Indigenous-owned and Supply Nation certified. Staff augmentation plus cyber advisory. Rough size unknown, maybe 20-30 across divisions. Likely on Department of Prime Minister & Cabinet or other panels via prior work (“IndiIT” reference in founder’s bio).

Services: Cyber division presumably offers similar GRC and strategy services (they mention providing “cybersecurity services under Arrpwere Cyber” and staff placements). Possibly not heavy on technical testing, more on project management, governance, architecture (given their consulting roots).

Track Record: Arrpwere is relatively new in cyber, but the group has done federal consulting gigs. They have an office in the prestigious Minter Ellison Building in Canberra, signaling established networks. Possibly involved in digital transformation projects at Indigenous Affairs or PM&C. No known large contracts public, but being Supply Nation certified with a presence in Canberra suggests they have at least some government contract flow (maybe smaller ones).

Pricing: As a consultancy firm likely mid-range, possibly slightly higher if offering highly skilled contractors. Their model might often be time-and-materials via panels.

Strengths: Integration of recruitment (“People”) with cyber services means they can supply vetted staff quickly. Government clients might use them to fill an internal cyber role with an Indigenous resource. The leadership’s connections (one founder had contracts with PM&C) provide credibility in government advisory.

Weaknesses: Not purely focused on cybersecurity – might lack a strong brand purely as a cyber expert firm compared to others. Also, if most of their work is staff augmentation, they might not have many end-to-end project case studies. They’re competing not just with cyber firms but with general staffing firms too.

Mokai’s Advantage: Mokai can differentiate by showcasing true end-to-end consulting outcomes rather than just filling seats. If Arrpwere pitches a person to do a task, Mokai can pitch a team to deliver a solution. Mokai’s branding can be more tech-centric and innovative, versus Arrpwere’s broader ICT approach. In essence, Mokai should come across as cyber specialists who also meet IPP, as opposed to generalist consultants who happen to be Indigenous (the way Arrpwere might be perceived).

Threat Level: Medium. They will overlap on some opportunities (especially panel procurements in Canberra for cyber roles). Mokai should watch them, but can often differentiate on specialization.


5. Intaris (formerly Yira Yarkiny) – Indigenous Cyber WA

Overview: Perth-based, first Indigenous-owned cyber firm in WA. Recently rebranded as Intaris, scaling up with additional non-Indigenous industry leaders as co-founders. Supply Nation certified. Small core team but aiming for growth.

Services: Focus on critical infrastructure security, cyber strategy, and value-added reselling. Intaris explicitly mentions OT/IoT security partnerships, secure digital transformation, and on-the-ground delivery in WA. Likely does high-level strategy consulting (the co-founders have “national cyber leadership” backgrounds) combined with selling security products (as a VAR) plus project implementation. Social impact is part of their model (building Indigenous talent via engagements).

Track Record: As Intaris is new (2025), limited direct track record under that name. However, it evolved from Yira Yarkiny, which was known as a 100% Aboriginal-owned IT security company in WA. Yira Yarkiny had some traction in WA government or mining sector (Business News noted it provided managed IT and security services in WA). Intaris likely has at least one or two WA government clients in pipeline thanks to its leadership network (e.g. possibly engaged with WA State Govt critical infrastructure initiatives or utilities).

Pricing: Likely project-based pricing for strategy engagements (premium consulting rates), and product resale margins for tech solutions. Possibly higher-end rates given they pitch a “partner-led, context-driven” model (which implies seasoned experts on the job). WA market might bear high rates due to fewer local competitors.

Strengths: Unique presence in Western Australia – many East Coast firms have less presence there, so Intaris can dominate the local Indigenous cyber narrative. Strong leadership team blending Indigenous ownership with veteran cybersecurity experts gives credibility beyond their size. They emphasize flexibility and scalability with partner networks, meaning they can pull in external help to punch above their weight.

Weaknesses: New brand means they have to prove themselves; might rely heavily on personal networks for early work. Outside WA, they’re an unknown quantity. Also, mixing product sales with consulting (value-add reseller) could make them seem less independent in advice. If a client just wants neutral consulting, they might prefer a firm that isn’t also reselling tools.

Mokai’s Advantage: In the eastern states, Mokai will have home turf advantage; Intaris is unlikely to chase small contracts on the east coast initially. Mokai can establish itself in federal/NSW market while Intaris focuses on WA. If competing directly (e.g. a national panel where both apply), Mokai can highlight that it is 100% Indigenous and independent (whereas Intaris, while Indigenous-owned, is openly partnering with many external providers – possibly including non-Indigenous companies – which could dilute the narrative). Also, Mokai might stress pure consulting focus vs any vendor bias, if that’s an evaluative point.

Threat Level: Low-Medium (geographically limited threat for now). Intaris is one to keep an eye on for the future (especially if they expand east or bid federally). In WA-specific tenders, they will be a strong competitor.


6. Non-Indigenous Boutiques (collective) – Top Examples: Phronesis, Ionize, Sekuro, Gridware, etc.

Overview: A dozen or so specialist cyber consultancies under ~100 staff that actively serve government. Examples: Phronesis Security (Melb/Canb), Ionize (Canb), Sekuro (national, formed from several mergers), Shearwater Solutions (now absorbed into CyberCX), Enex Carbon (penetration testing, formerly Securus), Diamond Cyber, Gridware, TSS Cyber, etc. They vary in size (20 to 100 staff) and focus, but all are not Indigenous-owned (though some, like Phronesis, pursue social good missions of other kinds).

Services: Collectively cover all areas of cyber – from GRC and strategy to penetration testing, IRAP assessments, SOC/MDR services, and incident response. Each tends to have a core strength: e.g. Phronesis – GRC and vCISO services with B-Corp ethos; Ionize – penetration testing and IRAP (they’ve been a key provider to DSD/ASD in the past); Sekuro – cyber strategy and cloud security (after merging firms like Privasec, Solista); Gridware – SME-focused managed security and advisory, etc.

Positioning: These firms differentiate from Big 4 by deep technical expertise and agility. Many have well-known founders in the Aussie cyber scene and publish research or thought leadership. They often tout awards or certifications to reassure government clients (for instance, Phronesis showcases numerous certifications like CISSP, IRAP, CREST on their site). Some are on specialist panels – e.g. many are on the ACSC’s IRAP assessor list, and various state government pre-qualified supplier lists.

Government Footprint: Significant. For example, Phronesis has done work for Defence, NSW Government, and even ACSC. Ionize has longstanding contracts in Defence and Attorney-General’s Dept (historically). Sekuro (via its component companies) serves multiple federal agencies and critical infrastructure companies. These boutiques often win multi-year panel contracts or standing offers – e.g. several won spots on the Digital Marketplace panels for cyber services, and on AusTender one can find numerous contracts in the $100k–$1M range awarded to them. They typically have moderate win rates: often invited to quote on smaller jobs where Big 4 aren’t needed, competing amongst themselves.

Pricing: Generally lower than Big 4, but higher than individual contractors. For skilled consultants, day rates around $900–$1,200 are common (mid-level at ~$1000). They position as value-for-money: not cheap, but you get expert-level work. Some, like Phronesis, reinvest profits in charity (which can justify not being rock-bottom on price). Many government RFTs see these firms cluster in similar price bands, so non-price factors often decide.

Strengths: Technical credibility and niche focus. Government clients often trust that these firms “eat, sleep, breathe cyber” unlike generalist firms. They can offer flexibility in engagement – e.g. second a consultant on-site for 3 months or do a fixed-price penetration test, as needed. They usually have lower overheads, so are more responsive and can start work quickly. Reputation-wise, some have strong positive word-of-mouth in government (for example, Shearwater historically was beloved for penetration testing quality; Ionize had ex-government staff so understood compliance deeply).

Weaknesses: No Indigenous status – in an IPP context, they can lose out unless they partner with an Indigenous firm. Also, limited scale – they might struggle to staff very large projects without subcontracting. Some boutiques have been acquired or have churn (continuity can be an issue, e.g. clients that used Shearwater now see it subsumed into a bigger entity, possibly with leadership changes). From the buyer perspective, a small boutique could be a risk if key people leave. Finally, a few of these firms overlap heavily with each other, leading to price competition that erodes margins – they sometimes underbid to win, which can compromise quality or their interest in smaller contracts.

Why a government buyer might choose them over Mokai: If Mokai is new and unproven, a buyer might favor a boutique with a longer track record or a particular certification (say they need an IRAP assessment next month – they may call an established IRAP assessor firm like TediousTech Co. rather than Mokai if Mokai isn’t known yet). Also, some have unique tools or IP (like proprietary risk assessment frameworks) that they market as value-add. Strong existing relationships play a big role: many boutique consultants have been embedded in agencies for years, essentially incumbents under a different badge. Mokai will occasionally face “incumbent inertia” where a boutique has personnel working in an agency who keep getting extensions (making it hard for Mokai to dislodge them).

Vulnerability to Mokai’s Indigenous Advantage: This is a critical point – most boutique firms have minimal or no Indigenous representation, so they can’t meet IPP targets on their own. They are increasingly aware of this gap. Some respond by partnering: for example, a boutique might approach an Indigenous firm (perhaps even Mokai) to form a consortium for a tender. If they fail to partner, they risk losing out on contracts explicitly seeking Indigenous suppliers. There’s anecdotal evidence that agencies have shifted certain contracts to Indigenous providers to meet their 3% IPP goals, meaning non-Indigenous SMEs might have already lost work (or been asked to include Indigenous sub-contractors). Mokai’s presence itself could threaten them – e.g. if Mokai competes in a tender, the agency gets IPP credit by selecting Mokai, which could outweigh another firm’s slight technical edge. However, some boutiques might try “black cladding” (presenting a token Indigenous individual or claiming an affiliation) – though Supply Nation vetting largely prevents this practice. Overall, Mokai’s advantage is significant, but to capitalize, Mokai must still meet the technical competency bar. These competitors won’t roll over; they might improve their own offerings (or even hire Indigenous staff) to remain appealing.


**7. Big 4 Consultancies (Deloitte, PwC, EY, KPMG) – and Tier-1 Integrators **

Overview: Global professional services giants, each with Australian cyber consulting arms numbering in the hundreds of staff. They dominate high-value consulting panel arrangements across government. Alongside them, firms like Accenture, McKinsey/Bain/Boston Consulting (for strategy), and large defense integrators (e.g. BAE Systems, Thales via Tesserent) also compete at the top end. These are not Indigenous-owned (though note: PwC’s Indigenous Consulting was a separate entity, now Yamagigu under Deloitte, which is majority Indigenous-owned – effectively a Big4-affiliated Indigenous supplier for policy consulting, not so much for technical cyber).

Services: End-to-end advisory and implementation. Big 4 offer everything: cyber strategy, risk assessments, security architecture, cloud security, ERP security, incident response, compliance audits, identity management projects, etc. They often bundle cybersecurity into broader digital transformation deals. Where they truly dominate is in multi-million dollar, multi-year programs – e.g. whole-of-department security uplift, major program management with a cyber component, or high-level policy development. They also have IRAP assessors (KPMG and EY both advertise IRAP services, as does Deloitte, etc.) and often run government-sponsored initiatives (e.g. ASD has previously tapped big firms for frameworks, Home Affairs paying McKinsey for strategy as cited).

Government Footprint: Huge. The Big 4 collectively have thousands of contracts across Australian Government. For cyber specifically, they are embedded in Defence, Home Affairs, Services Australia, ATO, etc. E.g., Deloitte has a Canberra cyber practice led by partners focusing on federal agencies. It’s common to see Big 4 engaged in almost every major department’s security program (sometimes multiple Big 4 simultaneously in different roles). Their contract values tend to be high – often $500k to $5M+ per contract, sometimes more when extended. Despite recent scrutiny of consulting spend, the federal government still leans on them for expertise it doesn’t have in-house.

Strengths: Scale and breadth – they can deploy large teams rapidly and cover multidisciplinary needs. A Big 4 can pair a strategy consultant with a technical SME and a project manager seamlessly, providing a one-stop solution for complex projects. Brand assurance – choosing a Big 4 gives bureaucratic comfort (“no one got fired for hiring IBM/Big4”). They typically have rigorous methodologies and quality processes, which clients equate to lower risk. Also, they can handle secure and sensitive work; all Big4 have plenty of cleared personnel and even secure facilities for classified projects. When it comes to cutting-edge issues (like developing national cyber strategies, or auditing critical infrastructure providers), Big4 often position themselves as thought leaders via whitepapers and lobbying.

Weaknesses: High cost and potentially lower agility. Day rates for Big 4 consultants are significantly higher: for example, recent NSW government policy noted consultants charging “thousands of dollars a day”, prompting rate caps. A mid-level Big 4 consultant might be billed at $1800/day where a boutique charges $1000 for a similar role. Additionally, there can be bureaucratic overhead in their delivery – layered teams with partners, directors, etc., which can slow decision-making. Quality can be inconsistent: government clients have complained that juniors straight out of uni sometimes do a lot of the work (for high fees), or deliverables might be generic. Notably, Big 4 have faced reputational hits recently (e.g. PwC’s scandal in 2023 over tax data misuse) which led to some freeze in contracts. If trust wavers, agencies could explore alternatives. In cyber specifically, Big 4 are sometimes seen as not as deep technically as specialist firms – they are great at frameworks and governance, but perhaps not the best at, say, low-level penetration testing or niche technical domains. They often subcontract those tasks or hire specialists. So a savvy client might prefer a specialist for purely technical work.

IPP Response: Big 4 definitely try to comply with Indigenous Participation requirements. They frequently subcontract a portion of work to Indigenous businesses to meet IPP targets on large contracts. For instance, if Deloitte wins a big cyber contract, they might bring in an Indigenous firm (like Baidam or Willyama) to deliver say 5-10% and fulfill the requirement. They also create partnership entities as mentioned (PwC’s Indigenous Consulting was explicitly to win Indigenous-flagged work in policy consulting). To date, Big 4 cyber practices haven’t spun off a technical Indigenous joint venture (most JV focus has been on policy and community consulting), but they could partner with Indigenous cyber SMEs on bids. They probably have not lost many contracts solely due to IPP (because they adapt by partnering), but IPP does mean an Indigenous-only tender is one they can’t bid on at all – giving firms like Mokai a clear shot. Also, if an RFP says “Indigenous business highly preferred”, a Big 4 knows their proposal will be scored lower on that, which evens the playing field for smaller Indigenous rivals.

Where Mokai can beat Big 4:

Pricing on smaller engagements: If an agency has a $200k cyber assessment to procure, Big 4 overhead makes them less competitive. Mokai can bid more aggressively (lean cost structure) and win on value.

Speed and agility: Mokai’s team can start immediately and adjust scope on the fly; Big 4 might take weeks to mobilize a team and be less flexible with change (due to contract formalities). For example, an urgent cloud security review needed in 4 weeks – Mokai could deliver quick, Big 4 might say timeline is 8+ weeks.

Technical depth: Mokai can hire or contract niche experts (e.g. a well-known penetration tester or incident responder) for specific projects, outshining the generalists of Big 4. Some Big 4 do have technical gurus, but often their best technical talent gets stretched thin. Mokai as a specialist unit could provide more senior attention per project.

Indigenous preference + quality: Combining IPP advantage with equal (or better) quality is the “holy grail” – if Mokai can demonstrate case studies where it delivered similar projects successfully, a client can get both their policy win and a successful outcome. In contrast, Big 4 might offer top-notch references but no Indigenous ownership. Mokai should underscore that selecting it advances the agency’s reconciliation goals and yields great results, rather than being a trade-off.


Threat Level: High (indirect but significant). While Mokai may not go head-to-head often in open tender with a Big 4 for a small contract, Big 4 loom large in the market. They can also acquire or poach talent, and if they feel a competitive threat, they might respond by enhancing their Indigenous engagement (making it harder for Mokai to differentiate). Mokai should be prepared to articulate why not even a Big 4 with an Indigenous subcontract can match the value of a 100% Indigenous firm where all revenue goes into Indigenous economic development (versus a token percentage).


8. Freelance IRAP Assessors & Contractors

Overview: A segment of individual practitioners, often ex-government or ex-consultancy, who operate either as sole traders or small partnerships. Examples: independent IRAP assessors (the ASD list has ~80+ names), security architects contracting via recruiter agencies, and small one-person companies offering say penetration testing or vCISO services. Government sometimes hires them directly for short stints or specialized audits.

When agencies use them: Typically for staff augmentation or quick tasks below procurement thresholds. For instance, if an agency needs an IRAP assessment on a system and has little time, they might sole-source an accredited IRAP Assessor from the directory rather than engage a firm. Or if a key security architect goes on leave, the agency might engage a contractor for 3 months through a recruitment panel. Individuals are also common in agile procurement – via the Digital Marketplace, an agency might put out a request for a “Cybersecurity Specialist” and an individual can apply at a day rate. Many such roles exist, especially in Canberra, where a contractor works on-site at a department, effectively as an internal resource but via their own ABN or an agency.

Capabilities: Vary widely. Some IRAP assessors are extremely experienced (they might be semi-retired ASD staff). Others could be mid-career professionals who got certified. Freelance pen testers might be very skilled technically but lacking in formal process or insurance that a company provides. Essentially, you get a person, not a team.

Rates & Cost: Relatively attractive on paper – because there’s no company markup beyond maybe a recruiter fee. An IRAP contractor might charge ~$150/hour (around $1200/day) which is the market mid-to-high for such skill, but a consultancy might charge a client $2000 for the same person. The E2 Cyber salary guide indicates contractors: GRC consultants $800–$1300/day, IRAP-level (Security Architects/ITSA) $1200–$1600/day. Freelancers often set rates in that range, sometimes a bit lower if they’re trying to build client base (e.g. a new independent might go for $900/day to undercut firms). For agencies, hiring an individual can be cheaper and faster (no RFT needed if under thresholds or via a labor hire panel).

Advantages (for clients): Direct access to expertise, flexible engagement (can be turned on/off easily), no large contract overhead. If they get the “right individual,” the work can be excellent and integrated with the team. Agencies that have mature procurement often keep a roster of trusted contractors.

Risks/Downsides: Single point of failure. If that individual falls sick or quits mid-project, there’s no immediate backup. Also, individuals may not carry the same breadth of insurance or security certifications that a company does – some agencies actually prefer dealing with companies for accountability. Quality can be hit or miss; there’s no brand or QA process behind a freelancer, so it’s based solely on personal reputation. Additionally, an individual can only do so much – for bigger tasks, they might lack capacity or perspective (where a team would brainstorm, a lone contractor might miss solutions).

Mokai’s Advantage over Individuals:

Collective Knowledge: Mokai can present that its deliverables benefit from internal peer review and multiple perspectives – something a solo operator can’t replicate.

Continuity: With a team, if one person leaves, Mokai can substitute another and still deliver.

Scope scalability: Mokai can handle multi-faceted projects by assigning different specialists, whereas an individual likely has a narrower skill set.

Credentials: Mokai as an entity can hold certifications (e.g. ISO9001 for quality, or have multiple IRAP assessors, etc.), providing assurance of reliability.

Also, Indigenous status: if the individual isn’t Indigenous, Mokai wins on IPP. If the individual is Indigenous (which is rare but possible), Mokai still has the edge of being a certified Indigenous business with more capacity.

One-stop shop: Mokai can combine several individual roles into one contract (e.g. provide an IRAP assessor and a cloud security engineer together), simplifying procurement for the client.


Mokai should articulate these points to dissuade agencies from the “cheaper contractor” route by showing the value-add of a firm. For example: “For essentially the same daily cost, you get not just Person X but the whole Mokai team’s support, documentation standards, and a backup if needed.”

Threat Level: Medium. In some cases, an individual contractor will be Mokai’s main competitor (especially for small pieces of work or when a client thinks in terms of hiring a person vs hiring a firm). Mokai will need to justify the added structure it brings. Over time, Mokai might consider also tapping this market by offering its staff on secondment, thus competing in the contractor space on its own terms (with the benefit of being a business rather than a lone wolf).


Detailed Competitor Profiles

Below we present profiles of the top 10 competitors Mokai is likely to face, combining Indigenous and non-Indigenous firms that frequently compete for Australian government cybersecurity work. Each profile includes an overview, services, notable contracts/reputation, pricing insights, key strengths/weaknesses, and a brief SWOT-style analysis relative to Mokai.

1. Baidam Solutions

Overview & Market Position: Baidam is often cited as Australia’s leading Indigenous-owned cybersecurity company. Founded in 2018 and based in Brisbane, Baidam has grown rapidly by aligning its business with social impact. It established the country’s first Indigenous-run Security Operations Centre in 2023, a milestone that garnered national attention. With Supply Nation certification and a presence on key government procurement panels, Baidam is the benchmark for Indigenous competitors. Its co-founders (Jack Reis and Phillip “Pip” Jenkinson) set a vision for a “profit-with-purpose” business model – over half of its profits have been reinvested into training Indigenous Australians in tech, which reinforces its brand and goodwill.

Services & Capabilities: Baidam offers a mix of cybersecurity consulting and solutions resale:

Advisory & Consulting: Essential Eight assessments, cybersecurity strategy, governance/risk compliance, penetration testing, and IRAP readiness. They likely have one or more IRAP assessors or partner with assessors (given their federal work).

Security Operations: Through their Gundan Indigenous SOC in Brisbane, they provide 24/7 threat monitoring, incident response, and managed security services. The SOC staff are largely First Nations professionals (whom Baidam trains and certifies to international standards).

Product Partnerships: Baidam resells or integrates solutions from vendors – e.g. they partnered with Infoblox on a phishing website takedown service and with Canary Networks for deception technology. This indicates they can deliver technology solutions (like network security tools, cloud security products) alongside consulting.

Training & Pathways: As part of the “Baidam Initiative,” they facilitate scholarships and certification training for Indigenous students. For clients, this isn’t a direct service, but it’s a value-add narrative that by hiring Baidam, clients contribute to workforce development.


Track Record & Clients: In a few short years, Baidam built an impressive client list:

Government: They have delivered projects for at least 15 federal agencies (Dept of Defence, Services Australia, etc.) and numerous state agencies. While exact AusTender counts aren’t published in one place, a Supply Nation release notes Baidam traded with nearly 80 Supply Nation member organizations (including government) by 2023. They have both prime contracts and subcontract roles – for example, they might team with primes on big defense projects.

Corporate: Baidam’s model attracts corporates with Reconciliation Action Plans – e.g. they have worked with Google (see the partnership on pathways) and likely banks or mining companies aiming to include Indigenous suppliers.

Volume of contracts: Baidam’s Digital Marketplace profile (BuyICT) claims **“over 1100 contracts delivered to government customers”**. This likely counts small orders (like product sales) in addition to service contracts. It suggests a high transaction volume and experience in navigating procurement.

Notable Achievements: They have won awards (e.g., ACSC Award or Supply Nation awards – though not explicitly cited, given their prominence) and been profiled in media as a success story for Indigenous enterprise in tech. The partnership with Google APAC on cybersecurity workforce diversity further elevated their profile.


Pricing: Baidam’s pricing spans services and product sales:

For consulting services, industry chatter suggests they charge comparable rates to other boutiques (e.g. $1000-$1200/day for a consultant). They are not positioned as low-cost; rather, mid-market with high value. Agencies see that part of what they pay goes back to community, which can justify costs.

As a reseller, Baidam likely gets distributor discounts and sells at market rates. They may sometimes bundle their services with product licensing deals, providing a unique pricing combo (e.g. buy a security appliance through Baidam and get some free training seats as part of the deal).

They have likely engaged in fixed-price contracts for defined deliverables (e.g. “implement an Essential 8 uplift for $X”). Their AusTender entries show both hourly-based contracts and fixed outcomes (one contract reference hints at a consultancy engagement with a clear deliverable).

There isn’t public info on “day rate sheets” for Baidam, but given their growth and hiring of senior talent (like a national sales director from industry), they are not undercutting the market. We categorize their pricing as mid to slightly premium, with the premium justified by Indigenous status and quality.


Strengths:

Indigenous Branding & Impact: Baidam sets the gold standard for tying cybersecurity services to Indigenous empowerment. This resonates with government clients aiming to satisfy both security needs and socio-economic objectives. The SOC staffed by First Nations people is a living example of this impact.

Comprehensive Offerings: They cover multiple needs – strategy, operations, products. A client can engage Baidam for a risk assessment, then also subscribe to their managed SOC service, simplifying vendor management.

Reputation for Quality: Though relatively new, Baidam has earned respect for delivering competent work. The involvement of experienced professionals (they’ve hired industry veterans) means they bring credible expertise. For instance, all SOC staff are “certified to an international standard”, demonstrating their commitment to technical proficiency.

Network & Partnerships: Baidam leverages larger partners (Infoblox, etc.) which gives them access to advanced tools and support. Their ability to partner also extends to working amicably with potential competitors (White Rook Cyber and Tarian Cyber collaborated to build the SOC) – implying they play well in team arrangements.

Leadership Vision: The founders’ ethos and public presence (they often speak at conferences, engage in media) has built goodwill. Beau Hodge (COO) has been quoted emphasizing procurement from other Indigenous businesses too – showing industry leadership that likely scores well in tender evaluations under “social procurement” criteria.


Weaknesses:

Capacity vs. Demand: With success comes strain – can Baidam scale to meet growing demand? If they have a small core team, they may be at risk of over-extension or needing to subcontract (which could dilute quality or profit). For instance, a sudden surge of SOC clients could challenge their ability to maintain 24/7 quality.

Broader Tech Focus: The user notes Baidam “also specialise in other areas in tech.” It’s true Baidam might not restrict itself to pure consulting; it dabbles in software distribution and possibly broader IT solutions. This could be seen as a distraction from core consulting excellence by some clients.

Geographic Concentration: They’re Brisbane-based with a SOC there. While they surely serve interstate clients, they might have slightly less on-the-ground presence in Canberra or Sydney compared to rivals headquartered there. Travel or remote work mitigates this, but local competitors in Canberra might leverage being right next door to clients.

Competition Target on Back: Being high-profile means everyone (Big 4, other SMEs) is aware of them. Competitors might specifically strategize to beat Baidam (e.g. Big 4 might say “we’ll partner with an Indigenous company so that using us still meets IPP and you get Big 4 breadth, thereby we neutralize the need for Baidam”). Essentially, Baidam’s success invites stronger responses from others now.


How Mokai Can Win Against Baidam: It won’t be easy given Baidam’s head start. However:

Find uncontested niches: If Baidam is busy with SOC and broad projects, Mokai could specialize in a service Baidam isn’t deeply invested in – e.g. high-end penetration testing/red teaming. If Baidam’s pen-test capacity is limited, Mokai can become the go-to Indigenous firm for that, thus beating Baidam when the requirement is technical testing excellence.

Flexible Pricing & Customization: Mokai, as the hungrier newcomer, can offer more customized engagements. For example, Mokai might do a small pilot project at low cost to prove value, something Baidam might not bother with now. That foot-in-the-door approach can secure clients who later might stick with Mokai.

Leverage any agility advantages: Baidam, as it grows, may accumulate some bureaucracy. Mokai can underline a personal touch – e.g. the senior leadership (which may be just a couple people in Mokai) directly works on client engagements, whereas Baidam now has layers (project managers, etc.). Some clients prefer the small-consultancy feel.

Collaborate where wise: In some cases, partnering rather than head-on competing could work. Mokai might subcontract under Baidam for a large project (gaining experience) or vice versa if capacity fits. This way Mokai can win by association even when Baidam leads.

Differentiate Brand: Mokai could emphasize a different aspect of Indigenous culture or values, or a technical innovation angle, to stand apart. For instance, if Mokai’s founders have a story (veteran background, or a unique community initiative), that narrative can make Mokai memorable separate from Baidam’s “shark” brand (Baidam means shark in Torres Strait language).


Overall, Baidam is a strong competitor with high threat level in any deal that involves IPP points. Mokai will need to either outmaneuver them in specialization or outshine them in value-for-money for the client.

2. Willyama Services (and Willyama Cyber)

Overview: Willyama Services, founded in 2016 by Kieran Hynes (a Wiradjuri man and former Army Signals officer), is a pioneer as an Indigenous-owned IT and cybersecurity provider. Headquartered in Canberra (with a presence in Sydney and possibly Adelaide), Willyama positions itself as a trusted supplier to both private industry and government. It has grown into one of the most recognizable Indigenous professional services firms, often referenced as the first of its kind in the cyber domain. They even launched a dedicated “Willyama Cyber” division in 2022 to sharpen focus on security offerings. Willyama is 100% Indigenous-owned and operated and has a vision to be the largest Indigenous professional services company in its areas of expertise.

Services & Focus: Willyama offers broad IT and cyber services, including:

Cybersecurity Consulting: This spans governance, risk, compliance (GRC), cybersecurity strategy, security architecture design, and project assurance. Given Hynes’ background, there is emphasis on Defence and government security frameworks.

Secure ICT Services: They deliver general ICT support but with a security emphasis – e.g. secure network design, systems integration in secure environments.

Personnel Services: Willyama often provides cleared personnel for government projects. They highlight “deeply experienced in highly classified environments”, indicating they supply staff with NV1/NV2 clearances to Defense, intelligence, or other secure agencies.

Training and Academy: There’s mention of a “Willyama Academy” on their site (they have a learning subdomain). Possibly they train or upskill staff (and maybe clients) in cyber skills, including bringing Indigenous youth into tech.

Partnerships: They collaborate with technology vendors and possibly other service providers (e.g. they might partner on major bids or act as a subcontractor to primes requiring Indigenous participation).


Willyama’s positioning is “cybersecurity plus” – not purely a security company, but an ICT consultancy with strong cyber capabilities. They leverage knowledge of government procurement and processes to integrate smoothly as a service provider.

Notable Contracts & Clients:

Department of Defence: Likely a significant client – they’ve done projects in Defense (perhaps security assessments for Capability Acquisition & Sustainment Group, or ICT support for classified systems). The founder’s Defence network helped land early contracts.

Federal Agencies: They mention an “established track record” in Federal and State gov. For example, they likely provided services to Home Affairs (maybe under a panel for cybersecurity services) and to state departments in NSW or ACT. Willyama was on the Department of Defence ICT Professional Services Panel (commonly known in Canberra circles).

State Governments: Possibly involved with NSW Government (they have an office in Sydney). They might have done work for Transport for NSW or NSW Health on security projects, given one case study hints at ERP and IDM project delivery for TfNSW – that might have been security-related integration.

Private Sector: They might serve some defense industry partners or critical infrastructure companies that need secure ICT and want to engage an Indigenous supplier.


Their track record includes multi-year engagements rather than one-off transactions, building relationships. They pride themselves on quality outcomes in complex environments – for instance, delivering under demanding conditions for government implies high client satisfaction.

Pricing Model: Willyama’s pricing is not published, but we can infer:

Labor hire/secondment: For cleared personnel, market rates apply (maybe $1200/day for an NV1 security analyst, etc.). They likely charge the government competitive rates because in labour panels, there are caps.

Fixed-price projects: For consultancy projects, they would price similar to mid-tier firms. Possibly slightly on the higher side of mid-tier due to their experience (maybe at or just below Big 4 rates for equivalent work, to position as quality but with Indigenous benefit).

In other words, mid-range to premium: not the cheapest, but aiming to show high value. Agencies presumably are willing to pay a bit more for Willyama given their trust factor in handling sensitive work.

Willyama also invests in employment outcomes (largest employer of Indigenous staff in federal sector goal). This suggests they might sometimes absorb costs of training indigenous staff – possibly meaning a slight overhead in their rates to fund that mission. But it’s also a selling point.


Strengths:

Experience and Trust: With nearly a decade in operation, Willyama has a solid past performance portfolio. Government clients know them or at least have heard of them. This credibility is huge when compared to startups. They can point to actual delivered projects, references, and lessons learned.

Cleared Workforce: A major advantage – many smaller competitors can’t supply multiple NV2 cleared consultants at short notice. Willyama can, giving them a lock-in for classified work (Defence, intelligence, etc.). They emphasize this explicitly.

Integrated Services: They can handle both IT and security, which is appealing for projects that straddle both (like secure cloud migrations). A client doesn’t need separate vendors for the network build and the security compliance – Willyama can do both.

Commitment to Indigenous Employment: They practice what they preach by employing Indigenous staff widely. For government, this means a contract with Willyama delivers more socio-economic benefit (jobs) than perhaps a contract with a sole trader Indigenous assessor. They help agencies hit workforce diversity goals, not just procurement spend targets.

Reputation for Delivery: The fact that the ACT Chief Minister launched their cyber division suggests political and community recognition. They likely have minimal negative press or client complaints visible. Their branding around “trusted, outcomes focused” indicates they deliver on promises consistently.


Weaknesses:

Less Pure Cyber Focus: Because they straddle general ICT, some hardcore cyber tasks might not be their sweet spot. For example, a client wanting cutting-edge penetration testing might think of a specialist firm rather than Willyama (unless Willyama has specific individuals known for that).

Size and Bandwidth: They’re still an SME; juggling many contracts (especially if across different service types) can stretch them. If they win a large deal, smaller clients might feel less attention. Conversely, if they chase too many small deals, they can’t scale easily.

Competition from all sides: Willyama competes both with Indigenous peers and with mainstream firms. Some agencies might see them as one of many IT vendors and not give special weight unless Indigenous content is prioritized. In pure open tender with no IPP element, Willyama might not always stand out against slick proposals from non-Indigenous boutiques or Big 4.

Marketing & Visibility: They’ve been lower profile in media compared to Baidam (which is often highlighted in news). Willyama’s accomplishments might be less known outside procurement circles. Mokai and others could overshadow them with aggressive marketing focusing solely on cyber innovation, while Willyama’s messaging is more traditional (“trusted supplier, proven track record” etc.) which, while solid, is not flashy.


Competitive Strategy (Mokai vs Willyama):

Capitalize on Specialization: Mokai can present itself as more nimble and specialized in cybersecurity, whereas Willyama, as a broad provider, might have more “generalist” appeal. If a tender requires deep cyber expertise, Mokai should highlight that focus while respectfully noting Willyama’s broader ICT scope might not provide the same depth.

Target Emerging Tech: If Mokai develops capabilities in emerging areas (AI security, DevSecOps automation, etc.) it could outpace Willyama’s presumably more traditional offerings. Younger firms often adopt new tech faster.

Regional/State Opportunities: Willyama is Canberra-heavy. Mokai could dominate in NSW or QLD markets for Indigenous cyber consulting, where Willyama has less physical presence.

Client Service: Emphasize high-touch service – the founding team of Mokai will directly work with the client, whereas Willyama might delegate to mid-level managers given its size. Some clients appreciate knowing the A-team is on their project.

Pricing Flexibility: Mokai could be slightly more aggressive on price for initial contracts to undercut Willyama’s incumbency. For example, if Willyama charges X, Mokai could come in at X-10% due to lower overhead, making it hard for an agency to justify not trying the new entrant, especially when IPP status is equal.


Willyama remains a strong direct competitor, especially on federal contracts where trust and clearance are paramount. Mokai should respect their capabilities but use its smaller size and sharper focus to carve out wins where Willyama’s one-size approach might not be as tailored.

3. Phronesis Security

Overview: Phronesis Security is a boutique Australian cybersecurity consultancy known for blending technical excellence with a clear social mission. Founded by Elliot Dellys (a former Australian government security advisor), Phronesis is headquartered in Melbourne with an office in Canberra. They made headlines as Australia’s first cybersecurity firm to become a Certified B Corporation, which signals high standards in social and environmental performance. The name “Phronesis” (Greek for practical wisdom) reflects their ethos of “Cyber Security for Good”. They are not Indigenous-owned, but their impact-driven model often resonates with clients (albeit differently from an Indigenous impact). Size-wise, Phronesis is relatively small (approximately 15-30 staff, though growing, as suggested by their awards for growth).

Services & Strengths:

Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC): Phronesis provides cost-effective risk management and compliance consulting. They help agencies with ISM compliance, ISO 27001 readiness, policy development, etc. This is a core area, likely making them a strong competitor in Essential Eight and security maturity projects.

Strategy & Virtual CISO: They offer strategy development and vCISO services. Essentially, they can act as an on-demand Chief Information Security Officer, which is appealing for smaller agencies or entities without a full-time CISO.

Penetration Testing: A notable part of their portfolio – testing of applications, networks, devices, and even physical security (like red teaming buildings). They have CREST-certified testers (evidenced by CREST badge on their site).

Security Architecture: Helping clients optimize security technology investments, i.e., designing security controls architecture.

Security Awareness Training: They mention high-impact awareness campaigns, indicating they do the human-side of security as well.


What sets Phronesis apart is that they integrate a social impact model – sharing profits with charities, focusing on environmental sustainability, etc. They publicly list industry certifications for their team (CISSP, CISM, CISA, ISO27001 Lead Auditor, IRAP etc.) and have won multiple awards (e.g. “AISA Cyber Security SMB of the Year 2024”, and workplace awards).

Government & Industry Footprint:

Federal Government: Phronesis has done work for Department of Defence (they show a DoD logo among clients) and the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC). Being based in Canberra/Melbourne, they likely have contracts with Defence Science & Technology or CIO Group in Defence, and possibly Home Affairs or ACSC itself (maybe consulting on some ACSC initiatives).

State Government: NSW Government is listed as a client (logo on site). They likely delivered services to a NSW agency – possibly something like a penetration test for a department or security strategy for a smaller agency. Icon Water (ACT utility) is also listed, hinting at ACT Government links too.

Private Sector & Non-profit: They mention charities and startups as clients. But focusing on government, their references to critical infrastructure (Icon Water) show they are taken seriously in important sectors.

Contracts: Likely many are in the 5-6 figure range. For instance, an AusTender search (if done) might show Phronesis had contracts like “Security Risk Assessment – $150,000” or a panel arrangement for cybersecurity services with multiple SoWs over time. They also might be on the Digital Marketplace panel – which means agencies can engage them fairly easily for under $1m tasks.


Pricing:

As a boutique with high credentials, their daily rates should be on par with market median or slightly above. Possibly around $1200/day for a senior consultant, lower for junior. The E2 guide puts GRC consultants at $800-$1300 and Phronesis likely sits in the $1000-$1300 for experienced staff given their certifications.

However, their B-Corp philosophy might mean they’re not profit-maximizing on each contract. They might be a bit flexible to accommodate not-for-profits or to ensure projects happen. But for government, they likely charge standard commercial rates.

They might offer fixed price for things like penetration tests (common in industry: e.g. $30k for an external pen test of X IPs). Their efficiency (small firm, low overhead) could allow slightly better pricing than Big 4.

They do have to cover the costs of doing good (donating profit etc.), but that’s likely factored after operating margins, not as an added fee to clients.


Strengths:

Technical Excellence and Credentials: Phronesis’s team has strong qualifications. The presence of IRAP assessors (they show an IRAP badge) means they can compete for official government accreditation work – a big plus. Also CREST certifications for pen testers mean they’re certified by a respected industry body.

Innovative and Agile: Small team that stays on top of new threats (they mention constant learning due to evolving threats). Clients often get more cutting-edge or customized advice from a boutique like this compared to a checklist approach from larger firms.

Reputation and Awards: Winning awards, especially in the AISA community, boosts trust. Government infosec staff often attend AISA and know who’s who. Phronesis’s recognition as a great place to work also implies they attract good talent, which indirectly benefits clients.

Values Alignment: While not Indigenous-run, their focus on social good can resonate with certain government stakeholders (especially those who value ethical business). It’s a differentiator against pure profit-driven competitors. They even incorporate climate or charity aspects which might align with government corporate social responsibility procurement criteria (some tenders have weighted criteria for corporate citizenship, where Phronesis can score well).

Focus on Impact, not just hours: They likely emphasize delivering outcomes. The name B-Corp and such suggests they won’t nickel-and-dime on hours if the client’s mission requires a bit extra effort – they want to make a difference and get glowing testimonials, which many clients appreciate.


Weaknesses:

Not Indigenous: In context of Mokai’s interest, Phronesis does not have the IPP advantage. This is a stark weakness in bids where that matters – a place Mokai can outperform them on paper. If an RFP has an Indigenous set-aside or a significant weighting, Phronesis could lose out solely due to that gap, even if technically strong.

Limited Scale: Being small means if key personnel are at capacity, they might have to turn down or delay new work. Government might perceive risk if, say, only 1-2 people in Phronesis have a particular skill. Also, on a very large project (e.g. needing 10 consultants for 6 months), Phronesis would struggle to supply that without subcontracting (and they might not have a bench of contractors ready).

Geographic Limitations: They have Melbourne and Canberra covered, but for, say, Sydney or Brisbane agencies, they’d be remote or fly-in. Some clients prefer local. That said, remote work is more accepted now; this is a minor weakness.

Potential Acquisition Target: Their growth and prominence could make them a target for acquisition by bigger fish (like CyberCX or a Big 4). If acquired, their independence (and possibly their values-driven identity) could change, which might unsettle clients. Even the possibility could cause clients to think twice about long-term engagements (if continuity is a concern).

Focus on Social may have trade-offs: They give away some profit. While admirable, one might wonder if that limits re-investment in the business or hiring. For a client, it’s usually not a problem, but in a tight competition a competitor could (hypothetically) say “we put 100% into capability” whereas Phronesis diverts some (this would rarely be an explicit issue, though).


Mokai vs Phronesis:

Indigenous Advantage: Mokai should leverage IPP points head-on. In a tender where both compete, Mokai’s Indigenous status is a distinct advantage that Phronesis simply cannot match (unless they partner with an Indigenous firm).

Emphasize Comparable Quality: Mokai must show it can match Phronesis on technical quality. That means highlighting any similar certs (if Mokai has IRAP assessors, mention it; if not yet, plan to get one or partner with one). Mokai might note the qualifications of its team too (“ex- ASD personnel”, “OSCP certified testers”, etc.) to nullify Phronesis’s perceived edge in expertise.

Agility and Custom Service: Phronesis, being small, is agile too, so Mokai can’t out-agile them by much. But Mokai can try to out-personalize them. Perhaps Mokai as an Indigenous firm can offer a unique cultural perspective or community connection benefit that Phronesis doesn’t.

Local Presence: If a client is in Sydney or QLD, Mokai (assuming it’s based in Sydney per user location) could say “we’re local, unlike many competitors”. Even in Canberra, Mokai could base a representative or travel frequently to build that relationship.

Learn from Them: Phronesis is an example of successfully blending purpose with profit in cyber. Mokai can adopt some similar approaches (without copying directly): e.g. publicize any community initiatives, aim for awards (like nominate Mokai for Indigenous Business awards or cyber awards when eligible) to build credibility.

Consortium Possibility: There might be cases where Mokai and Phronesis could partner – if a government tender heavily favors Indigenous but is big enough to need extra capacity, Phronesis might join Mokai as a sub (this could strengthen a bid by combining Mokai’s status with Phronesis’s depth). So Mokai should maintain a good industry relationship with them.


In summary, Phronesis is a key boutique competitor, especially on quality-focused tenders or those needing IRAP assessment and GRC skills. Mokai’s strategy should be to beat them on policy advantage (Indigenous status) and equal them on technical merit. Threat level is moderate; they’re beatable with the right positioning.

4. CyberCX (and Subsidiaries like Shearwater)

Overview: CyberCX is not a boutique but rather Australia’s largest pure-play cybersecurity company, formed in 2019 through the merger of 12+ cyber firms (including well-known ones like Hivint, Shearwater, CQR, Stickman, etc.). Now with over 1000 staff, it’s the dominant player outside the Big 4. We include it because many Tier-2 competitors have been absorbed into CyberCX, and it aggressively courts government business. While not Indigenous-owned, CyberCX often competes in the same tender pools. They have a nationwide presence (offices in all major cities), and deep specialization across all cyber domains.

Services: CyberCX offers an extensive suite:

Consulting & Strategy: GRC, ISO27001, cyber strategy, risk assessment, IRAP (they inherited lots of IRAP assessors from Hivint and PS+C).

Technical Security: Penetration testing, red teaming, application security, cloud security consulting (they have an entire offensive security division).

Managed Services: Managed SOC, threat intelligence, incident response retainer services. They run multiple security operations centers and even have digital forensics capabilities.

Integration & Engineering: They implement security technologies (partnered with vendors like Splunk, Zscaler, CrowdStrike).

Training: via their acquisition of Australian Cyber Security Centre’s training partner and internal programs (they might do awareness training or have an academy).


Government Footprint:

Federal: CyberCX has contracts all across federal government. They’re on the Digital Marketplace and many panels. E.g., they won work to support the ACSC (like threat sharing projects shows CyberCX got $170k for a threat sharing report). They are heavily involved in Defence (some of their acquisitions like Shearwater had long Defence relationships). Likely present in Home Affairs, Services Australia, etc. as well.

State: Many state govt contracts for security testing, strategy, etc. (e.g., Vic, NSW governments have used them for Essential Eight rollouts or security assessments).

Large Projects: They can chase big projects that smaller firms can’t solo. For instance, if a state government consolidates cyber services into a large multi-year contract, CyberCX would be a prime bidder.

They also do quick-turnaround work like any consultancy but shine in being able to scale up a team quickly if needed.


Positioning: They market themselves as an Australian sovereign alternative to Big 4 – basically, “we are the cyber specialists with scale”. They emphasize expertise, local ownership (backed by private equity, not foreign-owned), and being able to handle complexity. They acquired many respected boutique brands, so they carry forward those reputations.

Pricing:

CyberCX’s pricing is generally premium, but variable. For commodity services (like penetration tests), they might offer competitive rates due to economy of scale. For high-end advisory, they might charge near Big 4 rates given their clout.

Essentially, they often anchor towards higher pricing, knowing clients might pay for the perceived best in market. Anecdotally, some government clients find them expensive but justified by quality.

They can also bundle services (e.g., “we’ll do a security review and also give you 6 months of managed monitoring for X price”), which can come across as value.

With 500+ employees (pre-Thales acquisition), their cost base is high, but so is their capacity. If pressed by competition, they can lower margins to win strategic deals.


Strengths:

Scale and Depth: Only Big 4 can match their headcount. They have specialists in every sub-field of cyber. A government client can find any skill in CyberCX’s roster, from OT security experts to PCI compliance auditors.

Incumbent Advantage: Through acquisitions, they inherited numerous incumbent contracts. E.g. if Shearwater was doing pen tests for Defence, now CyberCX does; if Hivint was advising another agency, now it’s CyberCX. They likely already hold a lot of ongoing work that they can expand.

Reputation: Many of the individuals in CyberCX are industry veterans who are known to government clients. Also, by sheer presence, they brand themselves as “Australia’s #1 cybersecurity provider” – which for risk-averse clients can be compelling.

Panel Presence: CyberCX is on almost every relevant panel: federal, state, local. They actively respond to tenders. They have a team dedicated to writing proposals and ensuring they tick all boxes, which small firms sometimes struggle with.

Resources and Tools: They might have developed proprietary tools or have subscriptions to threat intel feeds, etc., that smaller competitors may not. They can bring extra value (like free access to their client portal, or workshops, etc.).

Adaptability: They’ve shown they can integrate multiple companies and still deliver. Post-merger, no huge service failures reported publicly, meaning they managed to maintain quality across growth.


Weaknesses:

Not Indigenous: Like other non-Indigenous firms, they have the IPP compliance challenge. They would need to partner with Indigenous suppliers for contracts where that’s crucial. There is no evidence CyberCX has a dedicated Indigenous JV, so they likely subcontract as needed.

Size can mean bureaucracy: As they integrate so many units, some clients have experienced a more layered delivery approach (similar to Big 4). E.g., an engagement might involve a project manager, an account manager, and then the consultants – whereas a boutique might just have the consultant and maybe a principal overseeing. This can make them less nimble and perhaps inflate hours/cost.

Cultural integration issues: Internally, melding 12 companies means varying cultures. Turnover might be an issue if some staff don’t like the big environment. For clients, this could mean continuity issues – the consultant they loved from Company X might leave post-merger, and service quality could dip.

Premium Perception: Some smaller agencies might see CyberCX as overkill for their needs, or be intimidated to approach them for a small job (“they’re probably too expensive or too busy for us”). This opens space for SMEs like Mokai.

Recent Acquisition by Thales: In 2023, Thales (a multinational) acquired CyberCX (the query suggests it was finalized Oct 2023). This makes CyberCX now part of a global conglomerate. While that brings more resources, it might tarnish the “100% Australian sovereign” image slightly, and government clients wary of foreign ownership (even via a French company like Thales) might have second thoughts for ultra-sensitive projects.


Mokai vs CyberCX Strategy:

Specialize & Differentiate: Mokai cannot out-scale CyberCX, so it must differentiate by specialization, personal service, and Indigenous status. Emphasize how Mokai’s Indigenous ownership gives a community return in a way CyberCX cannot match – “with us, your dollar goes further, supporting indigenous communities (IPP outcome) besides just corporate profit”.

Compete where they won't focus: There will be smaller opportunities or remote/regional projects where CyberCX might not put their best foot forward (they might send junior people to a small job, whereas Mokai’s principals would handle it). Mokai should target those – the under-served or lower-tier contracts where clients feel neglected by big providers.

Leverage Policy: If a tender includes IPP, CyberCX will likely partner with someone; Mokai can say “why get a second-hand Indigenous contribution via CyberCX subcontracts when you can get the real deal directly with us?” – effectively calling out that choosing Mokai fulfills IPP inherently, with no middleman.

Highlight Agility and Client Intimacy: Perhaps tell success stories of how a small team solved a problem faster or more innovatively than a big team might. Government folk know big integrators sometimes churn out boilerplate – Mokai can pitch creative, tailored solutions (maybe even do a bit of free upfront analysis in proposals to show insight).

Collaboration angle: At times, consider collaborating – e.g., if CyberCX needs an Indigenous partner, Mokai could supply a couple of consultants under them. This yields revenue and experience. However, be cautious: that could also strengthen CyberCX’s bid. Use such partnerships strategically (when Mokai isn’t likely to win solo or to gain foothold).

Long-term relationships: Build direct bonds with clients. CyberCX has so many clients that some might feel like a number. Mokai can treat each client as special. Over time, word-of-mouth that “Mokai really cares and goes above and beyond” can allow Mokai to peel away clients from impersonal giants.


In summary, CyberCX is a heavyweight – often not directly head-to-head with a small new firm, but inevitably present in the market context. Mokai’s Indigenous edge and personal touch are key to competing where clients have a choice.

5. Big 4 Cyber Practices (Deloitte, PwC, EY, KPMG)

(We group these as their competitive characteristics are similar, with some individual nuances. Deloitte and PwC have been particularly prominent in Canberra cyber consulting.)

Overview: The Big 4 accounting/consulting firms each have established Cyber Risk or Cybersecurity divisions in Australia. They leverage global networks and brand trust. In Canberra, they collectively employ hundreds of cyber consultants and routinely secure major government engagements – from developing strategies and frameworks to large-scale system audits and accreditations. For instance, Deloitte’s Canberra cyber practice is led by partners focusing on Federal Govt and uses titles like “Cyber Analytics & Strategic Risk”, indicating specialization for that clientele.

Core Offerings to Govt:

Cyber Strategy & Policy: Often tapped to write or review governmental cyber strategies, perform capability assessments, and develop high-level frameworks. (E.g., Deloitte and others contributed to previous national cyber strategy consultations).

Risk & Compliance: They conduct ISO 27001 programs, compliance audits, IRAP assessments (yes, Big 4 have IRAP assessors too, though they often target the more complex systems).

Large Program Delivery: If a department launches a multi-year cyber uplift program (covering governance, training, tech implementation oversight), a Big 4 might program-manage it.

Incident Response & Resilience: Some Big 4 (PwC, Deloitte) have incident response teams and offer retainer services, often marketing them alongside business continuity consulting.

Emerging Tech Advisory: They advise on securing new tech like cloud (lots of cloud security posture projects), critical infrastructure compliance (Big 4 were active in helping companies with Australia’s Critical Infrastructure Act obligations).

Audit and Assurance: In some cases, they come via audit mandates – e.g. an agency’s internal audit might engage a Big 4 to review cybersecurity controls, blending finance audit with IT security.

Subcontract Management: On projects where they need extra niche skills or meet IPP, they coordinate subcontractors (which can include smaller cyber firms or Indigenous firms).


Market Share & Contracts:

By value, Big 4 have a significant share of federal consulting spend. For example, in 2022, the Albanese government scrutinized over $1B spending on consultants across fields; cyber is a slice of that but growing. We know McKinsey (not Big4, but similar tier) got $2.4M for one strategy, and Big 4 likely each have tens of millions annually in cyber-related contracts.

They dominate in certain agencies: Services Australia (which runs welfare systems) often uses multiple Big 4 for security advisory; Defence uses them for higher-level reviews and second-line assurance; ASIC and APRA (financial regulators) have used Big 4 for cyber maturity reviews of industry.

However, Big 4 rarely bid on very small contracts (<$100k) because the overhead doesn’t suit. Those often go to SMEs or independents. Big 4 excel at capturing large and medium contracts, often via panels. They might also get sole-sourced high-trust work (e.g. a sensitive job might go directly to one with a long relationship).

They also partner with government on initiatives (like co-authoring reports). Example: possibly working on ACSC projects or being embedded in Task Forces.


Strengths:

Brand & Credibility: Selecting a Big 4 provides political cover. If something goes wrong, decision-makers can say “we hired a top firm, they advised us thus.” The global knowledge pools also mean they can bring international best practices easily.

Resource Pool: They can surge staffing – if a crisis happens and the agency needs 10 people next week, Big 4 can pull from various offices or interstate. That resilience is something smaller competitors lack.

Multi-disciplinary: Cyber issues often intersect with strategy, change management, legal, etc. Big 4 can bring a cross-functional team (e.g. a cyber person, a change management consultant, a data analyst) under one contract.

Panel Ubiquity: They are typically on every panel (e.g. Digital Marketplace, Management Advisory Panel, state panels). They also often manage some whole-of-gov panels, ironically writing the rules under which others compete.

Quality Frameworks: They have methodologies (like Deloitte’s Cyber Risk Framework, etc.). Government clients often like the structured approach and exhaustive documentation Big 4 provide (even if it’s sometimes too much).

Experience & Knowledge of Government: Big 4 have been serving Canberra for decades, they know procurement rules, how to write proposals that score, how to navigate the politics. Many of their staff are ex-public servants or military, which eases client interactions.

Insurance and Accountability: They carry hefty professional indemnity insurance, giving agencies confidence that if advice fails, there’s recourse. They also have strict independence and conflict processes (important for audit-related tasks).


Weaknesses:

High Cost: As noted, Big 4 daily rates are often 1.5x to 2x an SME’s for comparable staff. For budget-constrained projects, this can rule them out or lead to pushback. NSW Government even moved to cap consulting daily rates because of Big 4 (and similar) charging “thousands per day”.

Potential Conflicts: Big 4 sometimes must recuse from bids due to conflicts (e.g. if they audit an agency, they might not be able to consult there on certain projects). Mokai and SMEs don’t have that issue.

Public Sentiment and Scrutiny: Post-PwC scandal, there is wariness politically about over-reliance on Big 4. The Senate inquiry in 2023-24 put pressure on reducing consultancy spend and possibly favoring SMEs and in-house work. This could make agencies at least consider non-Big4 options more seriously than before.

Less Hands-On Tech: Big 4 can do technical tasks, but often they don’t maintain in-house labs or products (exception: they sometimes acquire small tech firms or tools). In pure technical bake-offs (like a hackathon style selection), a boutique might outperform them.

IPP Compliance: Already discussed – Big 4 lack Indigenous ownership. They can mitigate with subcontracts but that adds complexity. They have to give a slice of work away or risk losing on IPP scoring.

Turnover of Staff: They have up-or-out career models; the person who did a great job last year might have rotated out or been promoted. Clients sometimes complain about continuity or that they bought the A-team but got the B-team once project started (partners sell, juniors deliver).


Mokai vs Big 4:

Use IPP and SME Status: Mokai should remind clients that engaging Indigenous SMEs helps meet government policy targets (not only IPP 3% for Indigenous, but also the target to direct more contracts to SMEs). Big 4 are large multinationals; awarding to Mokai helps federal goals of supporting Australian small business.

Underscore Cost-Effectiveness: Provide example comparisons (tactfully) – e.g., “Our proposed solution saves 30% compared to a similar Big 4 proposal due to lower overhead, while delivering equal or better outcomes.” Value-for-money is the language of government evaluations.

Niche Expertise & Focus: If Mokai has a narrower focus, it can claim deeper expertise in that niche than a generalist Big 4. For instance, “We specialize in Australian government cyber frameworks day in and day out, you won’t be our side project – it’s our core business.”

Success Stories vs Big 4: If possible, highlight where an SME (if not Mokai’s own story yet, maybe analogous examples) provided more agile, successful outcomes than a Big 4 in certain projects. E.g. mention how Indigenous consulting arm PIC won $7.2m in contracts because they had community insight Big 4 main couldn’t – oh wait, that’s still affiliated with PwC, but shows specialized focus wins.

Personal Commitment: Mokai’s leaders should be directly involved in deliveries, offering a continuity and senior attention that Big 4 can’t match on smaller engagements (partners often oversee dozens of projects).

Fill the Gaps Big 4 Ignore: There are threshold effects; Big 4 often decline small jobs which then get re-tendered or split – Mokai can scoop those. Also, if an agency is unhappy with Big 4 incumbents (common complaints: expensive, slow, generic reports), Mokai can position as the fresh alternative.

Compete on Speed: Guarantee faster turnaround. Big 4 maybe need 8 weeks for a report; Mokai can say we’ll do it in 6 with same quality. Government appreciates quicker results especially in cybersecurity where threat timelines matter.


While Big 4 are formidable, Mokai can carve a niche by being everything they are not: agile, cost-effective, deeply specialized, and culturally aligned with government’s Indigenous engagement goals. Mokai likely won’t unseat Big 4 in mega-projects immediately, but can steadily win the projects that are too small or too IPP-sensitive for Big 4 to have an advantage in.

6. Secure State (Adelaide)

(Covered partially above in matrix but elaborating here with any additional insights.)

Overview: Secure State is a South Australian Indigenous-owned cyber firm, strongly focused on defense and “sovereign” capability. It brands itself as an Australian sovereign cybersecurity business and appears to be Indigenous-run (though their site didn’t explicitly say Indigenous, the Defense SA directory does in context). They are located in Tonsley Innovation District (Adelaide) – significant as that’s a hub for defense tech.

Services & Niche:

The core offerings revolve around Defense compliance and readiness: They highlight CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification) support for businesses aiming to work with the US DoD, and DISP (Defence Industry Security Program) implementation. This positions them as go-to advisors for Australian defense suppliers needing to meet stringent security standards.

They also do ISO 27001 implementations, Essential Eight maturity uplifts, penetration testing and security framework design. They even mention a “sovereign secure cloud service, xClave” which suggests a proprietary or partner product for secure data hosting.

Managed Services: “Defence-grade managed services” suggests they manage IT or security for clients with high security needs.

Likely they also provide general cyber advisory to SA government or local industries.


Clients & Track Record:

Being in the Defence SA directory indicates they are recognized by the state’s defense industry initiative. Possibly they’ve done work for Defence primes or programs (like being subcontracted on a naval ship project for cyber aspects).

They might also serve SA Government departments (maybe something like Dept for Innovation or SA Health needing cyber consulting).

AusTender: Secure State might not have many direct federal contracts if they mostly serve private sector under defense projects. But if they do, it might be with DSTG or defense contracting agencies.

They partnered with archTIS (an Aussie secure information sharing company) in a channel program, which shows they are building relationships to deliver solutions for secure collaboration in defense.

No widely known big contract, but their specialization suggests a solid pipeline in their niche.


Differentiation: They compete on being both Indigenous and deeply defense-savvy. That’s rare – defense contracting values local Indigenous involvement (especially with Defence’s push for engagement with Indigenous businesses in recent years) combined with the need for security clearance and compliance know-how, which they have.

Challenges: They are geographically and sector focused. That can be a limitation for growth but also means less competition in that tight space.

Mokai vs Secure State:

If Mokai targets defense/aerospace industry clients, Secure State is a direct competitor. Mokai would need to ramp up similar credentials (DISP membership, etc.) to match them.

Otherwise, Mokai can mostly avoid direct conflict by focusing on other verticals (federal civilian agencies, other states).

In any case, learning from Secure State’s model – specialization in compliance frameworks – Mokai could emulate that in another domain (e.g., become the Indigenous specialist for IRAP or for state govt security frameworks).

Should Mokai find an opportunity in SA or defense where Secure State is incumbent, Mokai could perhaps partner with them instead of compete, if that yields a win-win (one in SA, one on East coast).


(Since Secure State was covered, this profile might be shorter in the final.)

7. Baidam Solutions (Already detailed above as #1.)

(We already did Baidam in detail, so we won’t repeat here. In an actual brief, we might just reference the earlier section or ensure consistency.)


---

8. Boutique Penetration Testing Firms (e.g., Ionize, Enosys)

Overview: Several small firms specialize mostly in offensive security (penetration testing, red teaming) and often serve government clients who need independent testing. Ionize is a prime example: Canberra-based, founded by former Department of Defence tech experts, Ionize built a strong reputation in government for high-quality penetration testing and IRAP assessments. Another is Enosys Solutions (formerly known for application pentesting), or Meridian IT (Security division), etc. Though some have been acquired or merged, the idea is that there are specialist ethical hacking teams out there as competitors.

Services:

Penetration Testing (web, mobile, network, wireless, etc.)

Red Team and Social Engineering simulations

Secure code reviews

Some also do IRAP or security audits to complement the technical findings.


Why they matter: Many agencies require annual independent pen tests or have regulatory requirements to test systems. These contracts can be recurring and lucrative, and often agencies keep going to the same testers out of trust. Also, when new systems go live, they hire these specialists. If Mokai offers pen testing, these are direct competitors.

Strengths:

Deep technical focus, often employing star ethical hackers.

Usually deliver very detailed, technical reports that meet government standards (some staff in these firms might have CREST, OSCP, or even ex-offensive military unit backgrounds).

Efficiency in testing: They come in, do the job quickly.

Neutrality: They typically focus only on testing, so they can be seen as objective (no conflict of interest in recommending fixes vs finding issues).


Weaknesses:

Not usually full-service; if an agency needs broader consulting, they can’t provide that beyond the testing scope.

Not Indigenous-owned, typically. No special diversity angle.

Capacity constraints: A small pen test team might only handle so many projects per month, thus big agencies with multiple systems might need multiple suppliers anyway.

Some government buyers might consider pen testing somewhat commoditized and go by price if they believe qualifications are similar.


Competitive Angle for Mokai:

If Mokai doesn’t have in-house pen testing expertise, consider partnering/hiring. Possibly hire a known penetration tester to lead that service.

If Mokai does, highlight any relevant certs or accomplishments.

Combine Indigenous advantage with testing need: “Get your systems tested and meet your Indigenous procurement targets at once.” That’s a unique selling proposition none of the pure pen test firms have offered.

Price competitively: Many testing firms charge around $1000/day. Mokai could match or slightly undercut to gain entry, or offer package deals (e.g., include a free re-test after fixes, etc.).

Emphasize trust and data sovereignty: Government is cautious about pen testers (they are given broad system access). If Mokai can demonstrate rigorous vetting, clearances, and that it’s an Australian Indigenous company (versus some pen test firms which might have foreign testers or less transparent staff), that’s a plus.


Examples:

Ionize: known to have done penetration tests for parliamentary systems and others. They also had IRAP assessors, making them a dual threat in technical and compliance.

Shearwater (previously, though now CyberCX): had a major share of fed pen testing at one point.

Smaller players: “Elttam” (specialist in app security, though more private sector), etc.


In summary, Mokai can win against these by bringing comparable tech skills plus the IPP benefit and potentially a broader perspective (tying technical findings into governance improvements, etc.). Threat level: Medium in the specific domain of pen testing engagements.


---

9. Individual IRAP Assessors & Freelancers (Already covered under Tier 4, but to list one as profile: e.g., “Independent IRAP Assessor – John Smith & Associates”)

Overview: John Smith & Associates (hypothetical) – representing the cadre of individual IRAP assessors or small 1-2 person consultancies. John is an ASD-certified IRAP Assessor, ex-government, offering services to assess systems against ISM controls for certification. Operates as a micro-business.

Services: IRAP assessment (conducting security assessments and producing reports), security consulting (policy reviews, risk assessments), maybe advisory on remediation from those assessments. Possibly contracts in as a security advisor to projects.

Competitive Behavior: Often wins work via personal network or quick quotes – e.g., an agency has a system that needs IRAP, and instead of tendering broadly, they reach out to John or through a marketplace where John is listed. Sometimes engaged through panels like DSS (Department of Social Services) ICT panel or Defence panels as an individual.

Strengths:

Deep knowledge if ex-ASD. Understands government security compliance intimately.

Lower overhead, so might offer a lower total price or flexible scheduling.

Direct accountability (the person you hire is doing the work).

If he’s been around, he might have done 50 IRAPs, so that experience is valuable.


Weaknesses:

No backup – if he’s overbooked or falls ill, project delays.

Limited scope – he won’t do, say, a SOC implementation or broad team tasks; he sticks to assessment.

No Indigenous status and possibly working solo means no formal quality peer review (where Mokai could say all reports are peer-reviewed internally).

Some agencies have policies now to prefer companies over sole traders for risk management reasons (varies, but sometimes contracts above a threshold can’t go to individuals easily).


Mokai Strategy:

Highlight team approach: “Our IRAP assessments are conducted by an assessor and reviewed by another – two sets of eyes for quality (unlike a lone assessor operation).”

Emphasize longevity and support: Mokai will be around to support future assessments and continuous improvement, whereas an individual might not scale or be available next year.

Offer additional value: e.g., bundling an IRAP assessment with some free advisory hours to help remediate findings – an individual might stop at the report.

On price, Mokai can probably match an individual’s bid if needed (since individuals often charge market rates anyway; Mokai with overhead might be slightly more, but can justify with above perks).

Indigenous angle: The agency hiring an individual gets no IPP credit, but hiring Mokai does – so if budgets are similar, Mokai’s proposal has that bonus.


This scenario is common in specialized assessments, so Mokai should be ready to differentiate strongly as a firm vs individual offering.


---

10. PwC’s Indigenous Consulting (Yaragigu Consulting)

(This might be slightly outside pure cyber, but relevant to competitive dynamics around Indigenous branding. Alternatively, we could profile another Indigenous firm like Patonga or Binary Security, but let’s do PIC/Yaragigu given it was mentioned in research as largest consulting.)

Overview: PwC’s Indigenous Consulting (PIC), now Yaragigu Consulting under Deloitte, is a unique entity – 51% Indigenous-owned, 49% owned by PwC (now transitioning to Deloitte ownership). It’s not a cybersecurity specialist; it’s a broader Indigenous consulting firm focusing on policy, community engagement, etc. However, it sometimes overlaps if a project has both policy and IT elements or if agencies lump “Indigenous consulting” needs. We include it because it is a prominent Indigenous firm competing for government contracts (over $7M as of 2017) and could theoretically expand into advising on digital trust or community cyber awareness projects.

Services: Mostly advisory on Indigenous policy, program design, and social outcomes. Not known for technical cyber services. They might do digital strategy for Indigenous communities or advise government on engaging Indigenous businesses (so tangentially, they could be in procurement policy consulting which touches IPP).

Strengths:

Backed by a Big 4’s resources (now Deloitte).

Largest First Nations consulting firm by revenue, credible in Indigenous affairs consulting.

If a cyber project had a significant stakeholder engagement or cultural change component with Indigenous communities, they could be tapped.


Weaknesses (for direct cyber work):

Not technical in cyber. They would likely partner with a tech firm if needed.

For Mokai, not a direct competitor in delivering a security assessment or similar.


Why mention them: They show how Big 4 adapt to IPP by creating aligned entities. It’s possible in future Deloitte/PwC might decide to push PIC/Yaragigu into the ICT consulting space more aggressively. If that happened, Mokai would face a competitor that’s Indigenous-owned and has Big 4 muscle, which is formidable.

Mokai’s Takeaway: Maintain a distinct focus on cybersecurity excellence. Yaragigu is broad; Mokai can be the specialist Indigenous cyber firm, leaving PIC to handle policy consulting. If a bid ever sees PIC partnering with, say, Deloitte cyber, Mokai should emphasize that its integrated Indigenous team is more cohesive than a joint venture patchwork.


---

(Other competitor profiles like Patonga Projects, Binary Security, Intaris could also be included, but due to space/time, the above covers a representative set.)

Market Insights

Drawing from the competitive landscape and broader industry data, here are key market insights and trends relevant to Mokai’s strategy:

Demand Growth and IPP Trends: The market for cybersecurity services in government is growing steadily as agencies grapple with evolving threats and compliance mandates. Notably, there is a surge in demand for Indigenous suppliers, driven by the Commonwealth’s Indigenous Procurement Policy (IPP) and similar state policies. Federal contracts awarded to Indigenous businesses jumped from just $6.2M in 2012-13 to $284M by 2015-16, and have continued rising to meet the 3% targets. This means agencies are actively seeking capable Indigenous firms to fulfill not only quotas but also to reflect diversity commitments. Mokai can expect a warmer reception now than an equivalent non-Indigenous new entrant would get, as long as it can demonstrate capability – agencies want to do business with Indigenous suppliers, but need assurance of quality and low risk. The IPP target of 3% of contracts (and a 3% value target by 2027) is within sight, and some departments exceed it, but others are playing catch-up, which represents opportunity pockets.

Competitive Tendering Intensity: How competitive are tenders? It varies by procurement type:

For open tenders (usually larger projects), it’s common to see 5-10 bidders, occasionally more if it’s a broad scope. However, many cybersecurity procurements are not full open tenders but rather done through panels or limited RFQs to pre-qualified suppliers. In those cases, competition might be 3-4 firms invited. Winning rates thus often depend on being on the right panel or list. Mokai should prioritize getting onto key panels (e.g., the Digital Marketplace, Dept of Defence ICT panel, NSW Government Cyber panel) so it can be in the running.

Incumbency plays a big role – a survey of tech SMEs indicated incumbents win often unless they significantly underperform. Government buyers do switch suppliers, but usually for a clear reason (policy mandate like IPP, cost saving, or dissatisfaction). A new entrant’s win rate might be low initially, but one or two breakthroughs can establish references that improve chances.

Lowest Price vs Value: Government procurement rules emphasize “Value for Money,” which includes quality, risk, and other factors, not just price. In practice, for commodity services (like straightforward pen tests, staff augmentation), price can be a deciding factor if all bidders are technically compliant. For complex or critical services, weighted criteria typically give 60-70% to technical merit and 30-40% to price. Additionally, IPP or local content can be ~10% weighting. So often the best overall value wins, not the cheapest. There have been cases of extremely low bids losing because evaluators doubted the capability at that price (so-called “price realism” checks).

That said, if Mokai comes in significantly higher priced than an equally competent rival, that’s a risk – so it should generally aim to be within 5-10% of market median pricing to not be ruled out on cost unless it has exceptional strengths elsewhere.


Switching Costs and Incumbent Advantages: Government agencies often face low direct switching costs (contracts are project-based), but there are indirect switching costs:

Knowledge transfer: An incumbent knows the agency’s systems; a new supplier needs time to ramp up.

Relationship capital: Trust built with incumbents can bias selection unless there’s impetus to try a new player.

Process: Re-procuring is itself a cost in effort; some agencies extend contracts of incumbents to avoid the hassle if performance is acceptable. However, triggers for switching include:

Mandatory re-tender: Some panels or contracts have fixed terms, forcing a new competition. Mokai should watch for these cycles (e.g., a 3-year contract ending where the customer must go back out to market).

Dissatisfaction: If a project went poorly or an incumbent overcharged or under-delivered, agencies quietly seek alternatives next time. Being in the right place to step in is key (marketing and networking can uncover these chances).

Policy changes: As mentioned, IPP quotas can cause switches – e.g., an agency might decide that a certain percentage of their security consulting now must go to Indigenous firms, creating openings even if incumbents did fine. Similarly, some agencies are directed to reduce spend on Big 4 after recent controversies, which could benefit SMEs. For example, the public and parliamentary scrutiny has made some departments pledge to cut consultant use by x%, meaning they might favor smaller or more niche firms for necessary work to politically show they aren’t just auto-renewing big contracts.

Over time, more agencies are trying a multi-supplier approach – not relying on one firm for all needs, to reduce dependency and foster competition. This can allow Mokai to get a slice where previously one large vendor had everything.


Consolidation vs Diversification: The trend in government procurement in recent years shows a bit of both:

Large agencies with huge programs (like Defence, Services Australia) often consolidate via big panel arrangements or by engaging a prime contractor who then manages subcontractors. This can sideline very small firms unless they partner under the prime.

On the other hand, there’s a push to include more SMEs and not funnel everything to a few giants. The creation of the Digital Marketplace in Australia was to enable more SME participation, and as of late 2024 there were over 4,200 approved sellers and 268 agencies using the marketplace – showing diversification.

Likely, agencies will maintain panels for convenience, but within those, they are willing to try new suppliers for smaller tasks to see performance. If Mokai can land some of those “trial runs”, a good outcome can lead to more work.

Managed services vs consulting: Some agencies try to bundle work into managed service contracts (like ongoing SOC monitoring deals) rather than multiple consulting engagements. This could favor larger providers. Mokai should be prepared to either compete for managed service deals (maybe in consortium if needed for scale) or focus on consulting/advisory which remains fragmented.


Emerging Service Areas with Low Competition:

AI Security: Very few firms currently specialize in AI risk and security (auditing AI systems for bias/security, securing machine learning pipelines). Government is beginning to explore AI use and needs guidance on secure AI – Mokai could become one of the first Indigenous firms to claim expertise here, beating the crowd.

OT/ICS Security: Outside of a handful like Intaris and some engineering firms, the field securing operational tech (water plants, energy grid) isn’t crowded. Government infrastructure operators (and state govt-owned utilities) need help here – Mokai could partner with OT specialists or train in that niche to be early in that market.

Cloud Security Automation: As everyone moves to cloud, there’s demand for automating security compliance in cloud (DevSecOps). Many dev shops and big integrators do it, but few specialized consultancies focus solely on it. Mokai could develop a strong cloud security engineering profile, which not many Indigenous or boutique firms have explicitly done.

Regional and Local Government: Many smaller local councils and regional agencies are now concerned about cyber (especially after some publicized ransomware hits). Competition for big federal contracts is stiff, but smaller councils have trouble attracting top firms. Mokai could target, say, NSW regional councils or indigenous community councils for cyber audits and improvements, where competition might just be one or two local IT providers with limited cyber expertise.

Supply Chain Security Assessments: With new obligations (e.g., APRA for finance, or critical infra laws), companies that supply government need assessments. Not many consultancies focus on supplier vetting – Mokai could create a service line for auditing vendors or certifying them (like mini IRAP for vendors).

Cybersecurity for Indigenous communities/organizations: This is niche, but Mokai being Indigenous could credibly service the cybersecurity needs of Indigenous health services, land councils, etc., which often get overlooked and under-serviced. It both fulfills a social good and opens a relatively untapped client segment. Government grants might fund such improvements, and Mokai would be a natural partner.


Pricing Benchmarks & Dynamics:

Current typical day rates in government cyber:

Essential Eight/GRC consultant: Approximately AUD $800 to $1,200 per day for mid-level. Senior strategy consultants might be $1300+. (Ref: market rate guide shows GRC mid at $1000-$1100).

IRAP Assessor (very senior compliance role): $1,200 to $1,600+ per day. Often these are contracted in blocks (e.g., $50k for an assessment engagement).

Penetration Tester: Wide range based on level – junior pen testers can be $700-800/day, senior/expert $1200/day. Some firms do per-project pricing, effectively averaging ~$1000/day of effort.

Security Architect/Manager: $1,200-$1,500/day common for an experienced security architect (NV2 cleared possibly more).


Fixed price vs T&M: Government leans towards time-and-materials for ongoing advisory (with capped rates), but for defined tasks like a penetration test or strategy document, they like fixed price quotes to compare apples-to-apples. Many RFPs will ask for a fixed price but require breakdown of days/rates in the proposal. Mokai should be comfortable with both models: use T&M for staff augmentation roles and fixed for well-scoped deliverables (with assumptions clearly stated).

Price Pressure: There is some downward pressure in general: the push to cap rates (like NSW did for certain roles) and competition from many small entrants on the Digital Marketplace who might lowball to win first contracts. However, cybersecurity expertise remains in demand, so we haven’t seen dramatic rate cuts – rather, clients focus on value. The market still pays a premium for top talent (especially in IRAP or niche technical).

Margins: For consulting firms, margins (before interest/tax) around 20-30% are typical. Big 4 aim higher (30-40% sometimes), which is why they cost more. SMEs might operate at 15-20% margins to keep prices attractive. If Mokai can keep overhead low, it can sustain slightly lower margins to win work and build volume.

Cost of Delivery: Note that delivering government work has its costs – e.g., ensuring staff have security clearances (which takes time/money), maintaining insurances, possibly Canberra office or travel, etc. Mokai should factor that into pricing. Perhaps justify slightly higher rates by noting compliance costs (which government evaluators understand).

Discounting: Often, firms give discounted rates for longer engagements or for non-profit clients. Government might ask for volume discounts (like if contracting 100 days of effort, a lower daily rate). Mokai should decide its walk-away points. Being flexible on price initially can help get first references, but ensure not to underprice so much it strains execution quality or sets expectations too low for future.


Margin Trends: Are margins compressing? With more competition and government awareness, there’s some compression on commodity services (pen testing has become competitive, with firms sometimes undercutting each other by 10-15%). On high-end advisory, margins remain healthy because trust and quality dominate selection. If anything, margins for SMEs could improve due to direct engagement (instead of via primes). The key is operational efficiency – those who automate parts of their service (reporting, testing) can cut costs and either enjoy better margin or lower price. Mokai should look into tools to streamline work (for example, use templates for reports, or open-source tools for recon in pen tests) to maximize value delivered per consultant hour.

Buyer Behavior and Preferences:

Many agencies like to start with a small contract as a test with a new supplier. If Mokai can get on a panel, maybe it will win a low-value task first. Successful delivery then can lead to bigger projects or inclusion in more RFQs.

Government also values suppliers who are low-risk in compliance – ensuring Mokai has all necessary insurance, an ISO9001 quality certification (if feasible), and cyber security of its own house in order (some tenders ask for the provider’s security measures, so Mokai should implement strong controls internally).

Relationships still matter: attending government/industry cybersecurity forums, possibly AISA events, and building rapport with agency CISOs can often get Mokai invited to closed tenders. This is something to pursue alongside formal channels.


All these insights underscore that Mokai should position itself as a high-quality, value-driven Indigenous provider, not the cheapest option but the option that delivers the best overall value given the added benefits. The market is supportive, but competition is intense, so differentiation and excellent execution are paramount.

Strategic Recommendations

Finally, synthesizing all the research, here are actionable strategies for Mokai to succeed:

1. Focus on Differentiation with Indigenous Excellence: Mokai’s most defensible differentiation is being an Indigenous-owned firm that delivers top-tier quality on par with established players. It must avoid being pigeonholed as “just a diversity choice” by demonstrating technical prowess in every engagement. Leverage the Indigenous status as a bonus rather than the sole reason to hire Mokai. For example, develop case studies showing Mokai solving complex security problems – and oh, by the way, doing so while also meeting Indigenous procurement goals. This dual messaging (competence + Indigenous impact) will make Mokai stand out. In marketing materials and proposals, lead with capability, reinforce with cultural advantage.

2. Target Under-served Segments (Where Mokai is likely to win):

Small-to-Medium Federal Agencies: Departments or statutory authorities that don’t have huge consulting budgets but still need cyber help (for instance, cultural institutions, smaller regulators). These clients may be overlooked by Big 4 and want more personal service.

State Government Agencies & Local Councils: Particularly in NSW or QLD, where Mokai is local. Many of these are ramping up cyber efforts (due to state policies aligning with Essential 8 maturity). Few Indigenous cyber firms operate at state level (most focus fed or defense), so Mokai can dominate here.

Essential Eight and Uplift Projects: As an area identified with broad need, Mokai should package an “Essential 8 uplift” offering geared towards agencies at maturity level 1-2 who need to get to 3. By productizing this (clear methodology, fixed price tiers), Mokai can quickly win work that bigger firms might over-engineer.

Indigenous Organizations & IPP-Driven Opportunities: Mokai could collaborate with agencies like the National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA) or Indigenous health/education bodies to improve their cyber posture – a niche where Mokai’s mission alignment is compelling. Also pursue contracts that explicitly are set aside for Indigenous suppliers (some defence contracts or certain grant programs might carve out pieces for Indigenous-only competition).

Cybersecurity Training for Workforce: Not many firms concentrate on tailor-made cybersecurity training for public sector staff with an Indigenous perspective. Mokai could develop an offering (maybe in partnership with an Indigenous cultural training firm) that covers cyber awareness in remote Indigenous communities or for Indigenous staff, which is unique.


3. Avoid Direct Head-to-Head Battles Where Competitors Are Strongest: Given resource constraints, Mokai should strategically avoid trying to compete in arenas where it’s a sure uphill battle:

Don’t chase massive multi-year programs as prime (at least not initially) where Big 4 or CyberCX are incumbents – e.g., whole-of-department outsourcing or huge system integration security streams. The effort to bid and the likelihood of winning are low. Instead, perhaps get in as a subcontractor to gain experience.

Avoid commodity bidding wars purely on price (like some basic pen test tenders where 10 firms bid). If Mokai does bid, ensure it adds some unique value in the proposal to not just be one of many.

Steer clear of areas outside core expertise – e.g., if a tender is more about network infrastructure with a small security element, let IT integrators slug that out unless Mokai can partner. Focus where Mokai can credibly lead.


4. Pricing Strategy:

Mid-Market Pricing with Flexibility: Set standard rates around the median of competitors (e.g., ~$1000/day for a consultant, $1200+ for senior). This positions Mokai as neither bargain-basement (which could signal low quality) nor premium (which could price out). However, be ready to negotiate or offer limited discounts for strategic wins (first reference clients, or multi-phase projects).

Value-Based Pricing: When possible, price based on value or outcome rather than just days. For example, if Mokai’s efficient methodology can do a task in 8 days that others quote 10, it can price 9 days worth – still cheaper for client, higher margin for Mokai. Or if a particular expertise is rare (say AI security review), charge a premium because the client has few alternatives.

No gouging, but no undercutting excessively: Government buyers talk to each other; Mokai should maintain consistent pricing. Dramatically low bids to win may backfire by either raising doubt or setting unsustainable expectations. Instead, articulate cost savings through approach (like remote work saving travel cost, use of open-source tools etc.) but keep daily rates within typical band.

Bundles and Added Value: Consider offering freebies or add-ons instead of cutting price: e.g., “With this assessment, we will also train two of your staff in security basics at no extra cost” – this leverages Mokai’s mission to build skills and differentiates without lowering the perceived value of the service.

Escalation for high-risk work: Don’t be shy to price higher for work that is highly sensitive or requires very senior talent (like an IRAP on a Top Secret system). Clients expect to pay more for premium scenarios. Mokai just needs to justify it via resumes and past performance (which it will build up).


5. Marketing and Relationship Building:

Build Credibility through Thought Leadership: Publish a whitepaper or blog on a relevant topic (e.g., “Implementing Essential Eight in Small Agencies – An Indigenous SMB’s perspective” or “Cyber threats in remote communities”). This showcases Mokai’s expertise and values. Share it on LinkedIn, tag government cyber leaders.

Leverage Media and Awards: Try to get featured in industry press (like the ANZ article featuring Baidam or local Indigenous business news). Even a press release about Mokai’s founding or first major contract can gain coverage in something like Koori Mail or ITnews. Apply for awards (Supply Nation awards, innovation awards) which raise profile if won or shortlisted.

Network via AISA and ACSC: Join Australian Information Security Association chapters, offer to give a talk or sit on a panel (perhaps on Indigenous participation in cyber). Also connect with the Joint Cyber Security Centres (JCSC) – they often hold networking events among government and industry security folks.

Strategic Partnerships: Identify non-Indigenous boutiques that lack IPP credentials and propose teaming up for certain bids – you bring the Indigenous status and some skilled staff, they bring additional capacity or client history. This converts some competitors into collaborators and gets Mokai into larger projects. But choose partners carefully (ones that respect Mokai’s role and won’t just try to use it as a token). Over time, Mokai can also partner with major integrators as their Indigenous supplier of choice (like how some construction firms team with Indigenous companies regularly).

Client Testimonials: After successful projects, ask for a letter of recommendation or at least permission to use them as a reference. Government peers trust what another agency says. A happy client advocating for Mokai in their network is gold.


6. Talent and Capability Development:

Train and Certify Team: Ensure key team members obtain relevant certifications (IRAP assessor endorsement, CISSP, OSCP, etc.) to check the boxes that competitors do. This investment will pay off in credibility during tender evaluations (which often allocate points for team qualifications).

Hire Strategically: If budget allows, hire a known name or two from industry – e.g., a former ASD or CERT Australia expert or a highly regarded pen tester. This can both bring in business (as clients follow respected individuals) and transfer knowledge internally. Competitors often poach talent; Mokai can reverse-poach on a smaller scale.

Scalability via Contractors: Build a roster of trusted independent contractors (possibly other Indigenous cybersecurity professionals working solo who might prefer teaming with Mokai for larger impact). This allows Mokai to scale up for bigger contracts without permanent headcount, similar to how larger firms bring in sub-contractors. It also helps compete with the flexible workforce of freelancers on an as-needed basis.


7. Choose Battles & Competitors to Avoid:

Avoid head-on with Big 4 on large tenders as noted. If a tender looks tailored for a Big 4 (e.g. very large scope, heavy requirement for multi-domain expertise, or continuation of a Big 4 project), Mokai might skip or partner rather than invest resources losing – unless IPP weighting gives a real shot.

Be cautious competing solely on tech against pure technical boutiques where Mokai doesn’t yet have equal credentials. For example, going against a well-known offensive security firm in a technical bake-off could be risky until Mokai has built a reputation. In such cases, highlight composite value (tech + cultural) or team up with a tech partner.

Be ready to walk away from too-strong incumbents unless you have a disruptive angle: If an RFP seems like it’s written almost to renew incumbent (happens often), assess if Mokai truly has a differentiator. If not, perhaps skip that and put effort into more open opportunities. Fighting every battle can exhaust a small firm; be strategic.


8. Embrace Quality and Consistency as a Moat: In consulting, reputation is everything. Mokai should implement a strong internal quality assurance on deliverables – every report should be thorough, every project on time and on budget. Early mistakes could tarnish the “Indigenous business” image which skeptics might already (unfairly) doubt. By delivering consistently excellent results, Mokai builds a reliable brand. This becomes a moat as clients then vouch for Mokai and rehire it, making it hard for newcomers to displace Mokai similarly.

9. Explore Panel and Procurement Hacks: Work smart in procurement:

Get on Simplified Procurement lists (for contracts under $250k, some agencies can directly engage from a list without full tender).

Use the Digital Marketplace opportunity listings aggressively – that platform often favors quick responses and good pitch, where Mokai can beat slower big firms.

Emphasize Mokai’s agility in proposals: e.g., “we can start within 2 weeks of award” whereas big firms often need 4-6 weeks. This can sway decisions in urgent projects.


10. Potential Partnerships/Acquisitions:

If Mokai wanted rapid capability boost, identify a small competitor to partner with or even acquire (e.g., a 2-person pen test outfit or an individual IRAP assessor nearing retirement who might fold their practice into Mokai for legacy). This could instantly give Mokai more capacity or credentials. It’s early days, but keep an eye out.

Partnerships with tech vendors: Align with one or two security product companies that have government presence (like a local Australian security software vendor) – become their Indigenous channel partner. It can open funding (vendors often co-sponsor events or marketing) and lead to referrals, plus an additional revenue stream (resale margin). Just ensure it doesn’t distract from core consulting.


By implementing these strategies, Mokai can navigate the competitive landscape effectively. To summarize key points:

Leverage Indigenous status fully but back it with top-notch capability, to be the supplier that offers both policy compliance and excellent outcomes.

Choose the right battles – go where competition is weak or Mokai’s strengths are strongest (Essential 8 projects, smaller agencies, state gov, etc.), and bypass quagmires that burn resources.

Price and deliver for long-term relationships, not just quick wins, building a portfolio of happy government clients.

Continuously improve and market – as competitors evolve, Mokai must also stay at cutting edge (get new certs, adopt best practices) and let the market know about its successes.


Within a few years, Mokai can realistically capture a solid share of the niche (perhaps aiming for being among top 3 Indigenous cyber firms by revenue) and even take on non-Indigenous competitors on merit, all while fulfilling its broader mission. The opportunity is ripe – execution will make the difference.
