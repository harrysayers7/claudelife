## Deliverable Format

### Contractor Market Intelligence Report

```markdown
## Executive Summary

**Market Dynamics:**
- IRAP assessors: ~[X] active freelancers, high demand, 4-6 week booking lead time
- Pen testers: ~[X] CREST-certified, moderate availability, 2-3 week lead time
- GRC consultants: ~[X] available, readily accessible, 1-2 week lead time

**Key Findings:**
- Scarcity premium for IRAP and specialized pen testers (20-30% above base rates)
- Contractors prefer 2-4 week minimum engagements
- Loyalty driven primarily by: (1) Consistent work, (2) Timely payment, (3) Low admin burden
- Main disintermediation risk: Contractors going direct to clients after initial introduction

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Build bench of 3-5 IRAP assessors (critical bottleneck)
2. Establish retainer agreements with 2-3 core contractors (guaranteed work = loyalty)
3. Implement non-solicitation agreements with 12-month post-engagement restriction
4. Maintain contractor engagement via quarterly "state of business" updates
5. Target ex-Big 4 and ex-government for quality and credibility

```

### Contractor Sourcing Playbook

```markdown
## Sourcing Strategy

### Channel Prioritization
1. **LinkedIn (40% of hires)**
   - Search: "cybersecurity consultant" + "freelance" OR "contractor" + "Australia"
   - Filter by certifications (CISSP, CREST, IRAP)
   - Personalized outreach message template:
     > "Hi [Name], I'm building an Indigenous-owned cybersecurity consultancy (MOKAI) focused on government work. I see you're an independent [ROLE] - would you be open to a chat about potential project opportunities? We're looking for quality specialists to join our network."

2. **AISA Network (30% of hires)**
   - Attend monthly chapter meetings (Canberra, Sydney, Brisbane)
   - Sponsor AISA events (visibility to contractor community)
   - Post on AISA job board / Slack

3. **Referrals (20% of hires)**
   - Ask existing contractors for referrals (offer $500 referral bonus)
   - Jack's network (leverage systematically)

4. **Specialist Recruiters (10% of hires)**
   - Hays Cybersecurity, Robert Half Technology
   - Use for hard-to-fill or urgent needs

### Outreach Cadence
- **Phase 1**: Initial LinkedIn message (response rate ~20-30%)
- **Phase 2**: 15-min coffee chat (Zoom OK) - assess fit, discuss rates
- **Phase 3**: Add to contractor database, send quarterly updates
- **Phase 4**: When project arises, reach out with specific opportunity

### Contractor Retention Strategies

```markdown
## Contractor Engagement Best Practices

### Onboarding (First 30 Days)
- Send welcome pack: MOKAI overview, values, project methodologies
- Pair with senior team member for first project (buddy system)
- Set expectations: Communication norms, quality standards, reporting

### Ongoing Engagement (Active Projects)
- Weekly check-ins with project lead (not micromanaging, but available for support)
- Prompt payment (within 7 days of invoice = strong loyalty driver)
- Public recognition (LinkedIn shout-outs for project wins)

### Between Projects (Bench Time)
- Monthly "state of the business" email (pipeline visibility = they plan around MOKAI work)
- Quarterly 1:1 coffee chats (relationship building)
- Professional development support (pay for 1 certification/year for core contractors?)

### Loyalty Incentives
- **Tiered rates**: Core contractors get 5-10% rate premium for commitment
- **Retainers**: Offer 10-15 days/month guaranteed work at slightly lower rate (predictable income)
- **Profit sharing**: For exceptional contributors, consider small % of project profit
- **Equity**: Long-term vision - offer equity/partnership to 2-3 key contractors who become indispensable

### Red Flags (Time to Part Ways)
- Consistent quality issues despite coaching
- Missed deadlines without communication
- Client complaints (2+ from different clients)
- Ethical violations (bypassing MOKAI to approach client directly)
