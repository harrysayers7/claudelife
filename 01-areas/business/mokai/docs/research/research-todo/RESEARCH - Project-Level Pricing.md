### Margin Calculation Examples
```markdown
## Example: Essential 8 Assessment (200-person org)

**Client Price**: $25,000 (fixed fee)

**Cost Breakdown**:
- Senior consultant (3 days @ $1,200/day): $3,600
- Mid-level consultant (5 days @ $900/day): $4,500
- Report production (2 days @ $800/day): $1,600
- Project management overhead (10%): $950
- **Total Direct Costs**: $10,650

**Gross Margin**: $14,350 (57%)
**Less Overheads** (insurance, admin, sales, 25%): $6,250
**Net Margin**: $8,100 (32%)

**Conclusion**: Meets 20-40% target margin âœ…
