1. Market Structure Overview

The Australian ICT channel follows a two-tier distribution model connecting vendors to end customers via intermediaries. Global software vendors (e.g. Microsoft, Atlassian, cybersecurity firms) typically supply products to distributors, who in turn supply to resellers (VARs, MSPs) that service government or enterprise clients. This chain leverages each party’s role: vendors focus on product development; distributors handle logistics, credit and aggregation; resellers provide local sales, support and value-add to clients.

Distributors – Large wholesalers like Dicker Data, Ingram Micro, Synnex (TD Synnex) and Westcon-Comstor dominate Australian IT distribution. For example, Dicker Data (ASX:DDR) is a major home-grown distributor serving over 12,500 reseller partners nationwide. Distributors maintain vendor relationships and carry a wide portfolio (Microsoft, Cisco, Dell, etc.), offering resellers access to products without needing direct vendor contracts. They earn slim margins (often just a few percent) on high-volume sales and may receive backend rebates from vendors for hitting targets. Distributors also extend credit terms (e.g. 30 days) to resellers, easing cashflow, and provide services like training, pre-sales support, and marketing programs to help partners grow.

Value-Added Resellers (VARs) – These are IT providers that resell software/hardware and add services or expertise. They obtain products at wholesale discounts (via distributors or direct vendor deals) and sell to clients at a markup. VARs in Australia range from large ASX-listed integrators to boutique firms. Key players include Data#3 (a leading IT solutions provider with ~$2.8 billion in gross sales FY24), CompNow (enterprise Apple and IT reseller), Interactive (managed services and infrastructure), and many others. VARs typically earn margin on product sales (often ~5–20%) plus revenue from services (installations, support contracts, consulting) which carry higher margins. They rely on building client relationships and often hold vendor certifications (e.g. Microsoft Gold Partner, etc.) to demonstrate capability.

Managed Service Providers (MSPs) – MSPs offer ongoing IT services (such as managed security, cloud or support) on a subscription model. Many MSPs are also resellers: they bundle software licenses into their service packages. Instead of one-off resale profits, MSPs focus on recurring revenue. They might procure licenses via special MSP programs (e.g. Microsoft’s CSP or security vendors’ MSSP schemes) at a discount and then charge clients a monthly fee per user/device. The margin on the software portion may be modest (~5–15%), but MSPs achieve profitability through their service fees and economies of scale. For example, a managed security provider might resell a tool like CrowdStrike at a partner discount and layer monitoring services on top. Renewal management is critical – MSPs typically handle license renewals as part of the service, ensuring continuous income stream.


Margins, rebates and renewals: In general, Australian channel margins are tight for commodity products and higher for specialized solutions. A reseller might see only single-digit percentage margin on a volume Microsoft 365 deal, whereas a niche cybersecurity software could offer ~15–20% margin. Vendors often set Recommended Retail Prices (RRP) for software; the distributor and reseller discount off RRP determines their profit. For instance, a reseller might get a 15% discount off RRP on a software license and choose to pass 5% to the client (to win the deal) and keep ~10% as gross margin. In competitive tenders, margins can erode as multiple VARs undercut each other. However, if Mokai can leverage sole-supplier arrangements (see Section 4), it may capture full margin at RRP. In addition to upfront margin, many vendors offer rebate programs – e.g. quarterly rebates of 1–5% of sales if certain volume or growth targets are met, or bonus rebates for bringing in new business or contract renewals. These backend rebates can meaningfully boost a reseller’s profit but usually require meeting sales thresholds or achieving vendor certification status.

Critically, software renewals (annual subscription renewals or maintenance contract extensions) are a backbone of channel revenue. VARs typically get a smaller margin on renewals of existing licenses (sometimes a few percent lower than for new sales), but the volume of renewals provides stable income. For example, an enterprise security software might give a reseller 20% margin on the initial sale but only 10% on yearly renewals – still a worthwhile recurring revenue if managed well. Successful resellers put systems in place to track renewal dates and secure renewal POs well in advance, often using auto-reminders or dedicated account managers for this “long tail” of income. In summary, the channel ecosystem in Australia is a mature network of vendors, distributors, and partners where scale and relationships drive profitability. Large players like Data#3 and Dicker Data have scale advantages (Data#3’s multi-billion sales illustrate the market size), but smaller specialists can carve out niches – especially with differentiators like Indigenous status (as Mokai has) or specialized expertise – which can tilt opportunities in their favor.

2. Vendor Program Mechanics

Global software vendors typically run structured partner programs in Australia that mirror their worldwide models, usually with tiered levels and performance incentives. These programs govern how resellers engage with the vendor, the discounts they receive, and the benefits available as they grow their partnership. Let’s break down common elements using examples like Microsoft, Atlassian, CrowdStrike and SentinelOne:

Partner Tiers (Silver, Gold, Platinum etc.): Most vendor programs have multiple levels reflecting a partner’s competency and sales performance. For instance, Microsoft historically had Silver and Gold partner tiers (now evolving into the “Solutions Partner” designations) which required meeting criteria like certified staff and annual revenue in Microsoft products. Higher tiers signal a deeper commitment: Atlassian’s Solution Partner program similarly has Silver, Gold, Platinum levels based on annual Atlassian license sales and certified experts. To illustrate, Atlassian partners must sell an increasing volume of licenses each year to maintain status – *“partners can only keep their status if they sell a certain $ amount of licenses every year, and Atlassian raises this almost every year”*. Achieving a top tier often demands significant investment (training employees, reaching sales targets), but it unlocks better benefits.

Discounts and Margins: Vendor programs determine the base discount off list price that partners get. A new/small reseller may start as an Authorized or Registered Partner with a modest discount (e.g. 5–10%). As they move up tiers, the discount increases. For example, an Atlassian Silver partner might get around a 10% license discount, whereas a Platinum partner could get up to ~20-25% off Atlassian list prices. (In practice, Atlassian partners often pass some of this discount to customers as a deal incentive, keeping the rest as margin.) In a Reddit forum, an Atlassian partner noted *“partners can sell you licenses at a certain discount, usually 10% to 20% depending on their level”*. Similarly, Microsoft’s Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program gives direct partners roughly 15–20% margin on cloud subscriptions; one source notes a direct CSP partner can get about “20%” off Microsoft 365 licenses. Smaller resellers who are indirect (buying via a distributor aggregator) might receive a bit less, since the distributor takes a cut of the margin. For specialized security vendors like CrowdStrike or SentinelOne, exact margins aren’t publicly advertised but are often in that ~10–20% range with potential extra discounts for large deals. It’s worth noting that many vendors also provide deal registration programs: if a partner identifies a new sales opportunity and registers it in the vendor’s portal, they may secure an additional discount (commonly an extra ~5–10% off) to improve their competitive edge and protect that deal from poaching by others. Overall, typical reseller margins range from high single digits to around 20% for software, depending on vendor and partner tier. Vendors also may reduce the margin on renewals or low-effort sales since the partner’s role is smaller – e.g. Atlassian has reportedly lowered partner discounts on simple renewals.

Requirements for Entry and Progression: Getting started as a reseller is usually straightforward – most vendors allow new partners to apply online or via a distributor. The entry requirements are often minimal: a valid business registration (ABN in Australia), signing the partner agreement, and perhaps completing a basic training or exam. For example:

Microsoft: Mokai can join the Microsoft Cloud Partner program (basic level) easily. However, to resell Microsoft cloud subscriptions, the simplest path is to sign up under an indirect CSP provider (e.g. Dicker Data or Ingram Micro cloud marketplaces) which has no minimum sales requirement. Becoming a direct CSP with Microsoft is much harder for a small firm now – Microsoft raised the bar to require at least $1 million in CSP revenue and $25K in support fees per year for direct billing partners. Thus, a new reseller usually partners with a distributor who handles billing, while Mokai focuses on selling and managing the client. For on-premise Microsoft licenses or other software, Mokai would register with distributors like Synnex/TD Synnex or Dicker Data which carry those products.

Atlassian: The Atlassian Solution Partner program would have Mokai start at perhaps the Silver level. They would need to have at least one or two Atlassian certified individuals (training provided via Atlassian University courses) and commit to a small revenue goal. Atlassian’s program is quite accessible to start – many smaller consulting firms become Atlassian partners to resell Jira/Confluence licenses. Atlassian provides an online application on their site and often an interview or onboarding session. Once approved, Mokai would get access to a partner portal for quoting licenses at the partner discount. As they sell more and get more staff accredited, they can advance to Gold, Platinum etc. which brings higher discounts and benefits.

Cybersecurity Vendors (CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, etc.): These vendors typically have a partner registration process on their website or via their channel distributor. For example, CrowdStrike’s Accelerate/Elevate partner program has tracks for resellers and MSSPs. A smaller reseller can join at the basic level by signing up and attending some sales training. Entry might require an initial meeting with the vendor’s channel manager and a simple business plan outlining how Mokai will promote the product. Once accepted, Mokai would be labeled e.g. an “Authorized Reseller”. From there, achieving higher tiers (like “Premier” or “Elite” in some programs) might require selling a certain dollar value (e.g. say $100K+ annually) and having technical staff complete product certifications. Each tier unlocks better deal pricing and possibly Market Development Funds (MDF) for co-marketing. Vendors often grant MDF or co-op funds to partners at higher tiers to subsidize events, webinars or demos that generate new sales leads.


Benefits of Tiers: Climbing the partner tiers yields tangible benefits:

Better Margins & Rebates: Top-tier partners enjoy the highest discount levels. They also qualify for rebate programs – e.g. a Gold partner might get a quarterly rebate of 3% on all sales, or bonuses for exceeding a quota. Vendors like CrowdStrike structure incentives so that partners who invest in building a “practice” around the product get back-end rebates and incentives to boost profitability. These can include rebate dollars on each new deal, or accelerators (higher rebate %) if a sales target is surpassed.

Sales Support & Leads: Premium partners often get a dedicated account manager from the vendor, access to sales engineers for joint client calls, and sometimes lead referrals. For example, Microsoft or a cybersecurity vendor might pass government leads to a partner with relevant certifications (especially if the end-customer has indicated a preference to work with an Indigenous supplier – a point Mokai can capitalise on). Vendors may also invite Gold/Platinum partners to participate in joint bids or case studies, giving them exposure.

Marketing Development Funds (MDF): At higher tiers, vendors set aside funds to co-fund marketing initiatives by the partner. Mokai could propose a webinar for government clients on cloud security; a vendor like SentinelOne might fund 50% of the costs if Mokai is a committed partner. MDF often requires a plan and proof of execution (e.g. outcomes of a campaign).

Training & Certification: All levels of partner programs offer training resources, but advanced tiers might get free or discounted training vouchers, priority access to new certifications or beta programs, and invites to partner-only conferences. For instance, Microsoft’s top partners get a number of free exam vouchers and may attend the Microsoft Inspire conference with subsidized tickets. These help the partner build expertise.

Use of Partner Logos & Listing: Achieving a tier allows Mokai to market itself as e.g. “CrowdStrike Managed Security Provider – Silver” or “Atlassian Gold Solution Partner”, which lends credibility. Vendors often list higher-tier partners on their website directories so customers can find them. This visibility can generate inbound leads.


Smaller Reseller Pathways: For a newcomer like Mokai, the logical approach is to start at entry-level with key vendors and leverage distributors for support. There is typically no hefty upfront investment beyond training time and possibly a program fee (Microsoft has a low annual partner network fee for certain competencies, others like Atlassian don’t charge a fee but require training). Vendor support at this stage often comes via distributor: e.g. Dicker Data or Ingram Micro will provide Mokai with quoting tools, basic sales training, and help registering deals with the vendor. As Mokai proves itself with a few customer wins, it can quickly progress. One strategic tip is to highlight Mokai’s Indigenous status to vendors – many vendors have diversity initiatives and are eager to cultivate Indigenous partners (for ESG reasons and because it can open doors in government accounts). By communicating this, Mokai may receive extra support. For example, when CrowdStrike onboarded Baidam Solutions (an Indigenous partner), CrowdStrike’s regional channel VP noted how Baidam’s mission and community focus aligned with the vendor’s values. This alignment can lead to deeper collaboration even if the partner is small. In summary, vendor programs are structured but flexible – they set a roadmap for Mokai to gain skills and better margins over time. Starting small is not a barrier; plenty of boutique Australian firms have become Gold partners in specific niches by building expertise and meeting reasonable targets. With Mokai’s focus areas (Microsoft software, Atlassian, cybersecurity), enrolling in those vendor programs early is key to access pricing and resources, and then it’s about delivering sales and getting certified to climb the tier ladder, unlocking the full benefits (better margins, MDF, lead flow) as the business grows.


3. Financial Model Breakdown

Understanding the flow of revenue and costs in a reseller transaction is crucial for Mokai’s financial planning. Below is a breakdown of the revenue model from vendor to end-client, highlighting where Mokai earns profit and how cash flows through the channel:

Revenue Flow: Vendor → Distributor → Mokai → Client

1. Vendor to Distributor: Software vendors sell licenses to their authorized distributors at a wholesale rate. For instance, a vendor might sell a $100,000 (RRP) software subscription to a distributor for, say, $70,000 (a 30% discount off list). This built-in margin is split down the chain. The distributor pays $70K to the vendor, and now holds the license entitlement to resell.


2. Distributor to Reseller (Mokai): The distributor adds a small markup and resells to Mokai. In our example, the distributor might sell it to Mokai for $80,000. That means the distributor keeps $10K (around a 12–15% margin in this hypothetical case) as their cut. Distributors operate on thin margins, often well under 10% – their business is about high volume across thousands of deals. (For commodity Microsoft licenses, the distributor margin might be just a few percent.) They compensate with backend rebates from vendors for large sales volumes. Importantly, Mokai doesn’t pay immediately upon ordering; distributors extend credit terms (typically net 30 days EOM). So if Mokai buys on April 1, payment might not be due until May 30, which helps align with receiving client payment.


3. Reseller (Mokai) to Client: Mokai quotes the client a sale price. Ideally this is close to the vendor’s list price (to maximize margin), but market conditions and value-for-money considerations influence it. In a non-competitive, sole-source procurement (leveraging Mokai’s IPP advantage), Mokai could reasonably charge the full list price if that’s considered fair market value. However, if a client expects some savings or if Mokai wants to ensure the pricing is compelling, Mokai might offer a slight discount off RRP. For example, Mokai could quote the client $95,000 (5% off list). The client issues a purchase order for $95K to Mokai. Mokai’s gross profit in this scenario would be the spread between $95K (sale price) and $80K (cost) = $15,000. That’s effectively a 15% gross margin on the deal. This gross margin must cover Mokai’s operating costs and risk (including any credit extended to the client). If the procurement was competitive (multiple quotes), Mokai might have to lower the price further, shrinking the margin. Conversely, if Mokai is uniquely positioned (sole source) and the client was expecting to pay list price anyway, Mokai might capture a higher portion of the margin.


4. Client Payment and Timing: The client (government agency or enterprise) will pay according to agreed terms, usually 30 days from invoice. Government agencies are generally reliable payers but can sometimes have administrative delays. Let’s say Mokai delivers the license and invoices the $95K on April 5, due May 5. The distributor’s invoice for $80K might be due April 30 or May 5 (depending on exact terms). In a perfect case, Mokai receives the $95K from the client before it must pay the distributor’s $80K, allowing it to comfortably cover the cost and retain $15K. However, there is a cashflow risk: if the client’s payment is delayed (e.g. they pay on day 45 or 60), Mokai might have to pay the distributor first out of pocket. Managing this timing is critical – new resellers often encounter cash crunches if a large invoice isn’t paid promptly. Mitigation strategies include negotiating longer credit terms for large orders with distributors, or leveraging financing (some distributors offer invoice financing or one-off extended terms for strategic deals).


5. Vendor Rebates/Incentives: After the sale, additional profit can come from vendor incentive programs:

Rebates: If this sale qualified for a vendor rebate (for example, the vendor has a Q2 promotion of 5% rebate on all deals over $100K, or Mokai’s partner tier gives a 3% rebate on all sales), Mokai would receive that rebate later (often paid quarterly). On a $95K sale, a 3% rebate would be $2,850 back to Mokai. That effectively increases the margin from $15K to ~$17.85K, pushing realized margin from 15% to ~18.8%. Rebates typically come as a credit note or payment from the vendor/distributor after quarter-end.

Deal Registration Discounts: If Mokai had registered this deal with the vendor for special pricing (common in cybersecurity deals), the cost to the distributor might have been lower to begin with. For example, CrowdStrike might approve an extra 5% discount for a new customer deal registration. The distributor would then pass that on to Mokai. In effect Mokai’s cost could drop to $75K instead of $80K, giving Mokai more profit or room to discount to the client. These “front-end” incentives are a form of margin but applied during quoting.

Renewal Commission: For subscription software, vendors often rely on the partner to manage renewals. On the annual renewal of this $100K software next year, the pricing might remain $100K (assuming no vendor increase). The vendor/distributor might only give Mokai, say, a 10% margin on the renewal (since it’s an easier repeat sale) – meaning Mokai pays $90K, can charge the client $100K (or again maybe $95K to be nice) and keep ~$5–10K. While lower in dollar value than the initial sale, the renewal margin is essentially recurring profit for minimal effort beyond a bit of admin and customer care. Over time, a base of renewals can become very lucrative.




Real-World Margin Examples: Margins vary by product category:

Productivity SaaS (Low Margin): Cloud suites like Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace are high-volume, price-sensitive products. Resellers often see only 5–10% margin on these if sold standalone. Indeed, Microsoft’s CSP model for cloud doesn’t allow much more than ~15% even for top partners, and many partners pass most of that to customers to stay competitive (especially since clients can buy direct from Microsoft, the partner has to justify their involvement with either a slight discount or better service). Thus, reselling M365 alone is thin – many partners wrap it in managed services to boost effective margins.

Enterprise Software & Cybersecurity (Mid Margin): Niche or complex software (firewall solutions, security software like CrowdStrike/SentinelOne, IT management tools, etc.) often come with margin in the 15–20% range for partners. Vendors in these spaces rely heavily on channel partners for sales and are willing to reward them. For instance, a next-gen antivirus deal might give a partner 20% off list price. If the partner registers the deal and it’s new business, they might get an extra 5%, achieving 25% discount. The partner could then comfortably give the customer 5–10% off list and still net ~15% margin. In cybersecurity, vendors also encourage multi-year deals (e.g. 3-year subscription) with extra discount – a partner could see a bulk margin but must handle the cashflow of a multi-year payment at once.

Software Maintenance Renewals: For traditional on-prem software with annual maintenance (or support contracts for hardware), the renewal margin might be lower (around 5–10%). For example, Cisco hardware maintenance renewals often give partners ~8% margin. However, these are almost guaranteed revenue if you manage them well, and sometimes vendors give a renewal rebate if a partner achieves a high renewal rate (to incentivize partners not to let contracts lapse).

Managed Services Bundles: If Mokai packages software within a managed service (for instance, offering “Compliance-as-a-Service” including a compliance software license), the margin on the software might remain whatever the partner discount is, but Mokai would add a significant service fee. This can yield effective gross margins of 30–50% on the overall package. The key is that the license cost becomes a pass-through and the value pricing is in the service.


Cashflow Cycles: Typically:

Upfront billing vs terms: Government clients usually prefer annual upfront billing for software (paying for 12 months in one go). This means a chunky payment to manage. If Mokai has 30-day terms with its supplier but the government takes 45 days to pay, there’s a 15-day gap where Mokai’s cash is out of pocket. Over multiple big deals, this can strain working capital. As a mitigation, Mokai can arrange a credit line or use invoice financing for large orders if needed, or negotiate extended terms with distributors for first big deals (distributors sometimes offer 60-day terms on a case-by-case basis for strategic partners or charge a small fee for it).

30-day standard: Both sides of the chain often align around net 30 days, so in many cases it works out. Some agencies will pay faster (especially to Indigenous suppliers, as part of supplier diversity commitments some aim to pay within 15 days). Monitoring and following up on payments is prudent – any delays should be caught early so distributor payments can potentially be adjusted.

Multi-year deals: If a client commits to a multi-year license/subscription, they may insist on being billed annually (government budgeting often doesn’t allow paying 3 years upfront). In that case, the vendor/distributor might also charge annually. Alternatively, if a vendor gives a discount for 3 years upfront and the client can pay it, Mokai must ensure it can either pay the upstream cost each year or secure financing if the vendor wants a lump sum. Often, big vendors will accept annual billing cycles matching the client, as long as all paperwork is in place.

Renewal timeline: A best practice is to start the renewal quote process 90 days before expiry. For instance, if a software expires June 30, 2026, Mokai should reach out by April 1, 2026 with a renewal quote. This gives time to resolve any budget issues or purchase order delays on the client side. Many government clients actually require renewal quotes 60-90 days in advance to ensure continuity. Vendors usually send reminders to partners about upcoming renewals, but Mokai shouldn’t rely solely on that – maintaining its own CRM or spreadsheet of renewal dates is vital.


In summary, Mokai’s profit in reselling will come from carefully managing the buy low, sell slightly higher equation, while leveraging vendor rebates and ensuring minimal leakage of margin. The example above shows that even a ~15% margin can translate to meaningful dollars on large contracts. By focusing on products with recurring revenue, Mokai can build a layered income stream year over year (each new sale adds a future renewal). The financial success will depend on operational discipline: quoting correctly, not over-discounting unless needed, securing on-time payments, and using vendor incentives. With government clients, Mokai has an edge (no heavy price haggling if sole-sourced), but it still must prove value for money – meaning its pricing should be justified as equivalent to market rates (this generally allows keeping standard margins). By understanding this flow and planning for the cash cycle, Mokai can avoid the common pitfall of growing sales but running out of cash – instead, it can grow a healthy, profitable recurring revenue base as envisioned.

4. Regulatory & Procurement Landscape

Selling software to Australian government agencies involves navigating procurement rules and leveraging policies designed to promote opportunities for businesses like Mokai. Key factors in this landscape include the Indigenous Procurement Policy (IPP) and specific mechanisms like Exemption 16, as well as various procurement panels and marketplaces. Below, we explain these and how Mokai’s status can turn them into a strategic advantage:

Indigenous Procurement Policy (IPP): The IPP is a Federal Government policy aimed at increasing Indigenous-owned businesses’ participation in government contracting. It sets targets (originally 3% of all contracts by number to Indigenous suppliers, with additional value targets in recent updates) and includes measures to facilitate Indigenous involvement. One major mechanism is the Mandatory Set-Aside (MSA): for procurements between $80,000 and $200,000 (inc GST) that are to be delivered in Australia (and for any value if in remote areas), agencies must first consider Indigenous businesses before going to an open tender. In practice, this means if an agency needs, say, a $150K software license, they should check if an Indigenous supplier (like Mokai) can meet the requirement at a value-for-money price. Only if no Indigenous option is available or competitive should they proceed to tender. This MSA has steered many smaller procurements towards Indigenous SMEs.

Exemption 16 (Commonwealth Procurement Rules): This is a powerful provision that allows departments to directly engage an Indigenous small-to-medium enterprise (SME) for contracts of any size without a normal competitive tender, as long as they achieve value for money. In essence, Exemption 16 creates a sole-source pathway: an agency can say “we choose this Indigenous supplier” and bypass the lengthy open market solicitation. Notably, Exemption 16 has no financial threshold limit – agencies have used it for very large contracts. In fact, one submission noted the largest Exemption 16 contract known was about $213 million in value. This underscores that even big projects (with proper approvals) can be awarded directly to an Indigenous firm. The only conditions are that the supplier must be at least 50% Indigenous-owned (Mokai qualifies via Supply Nation certification) and the agency must be confident the choice represents value for money (VFM). VFM doesn’t necessarily mean the absolute cheapest price; it means the price is reasonable for the outcome and factors in the supplier’s capabilities, risk, etc. If Mokai is offering the same software at a similar price as non-Indigenous competitors, then awarding to Mokai under Exemption 16 would meet VFM due diligence, especially considering the broader economic benefit of supporting Indigenous business (which agencies can factor into value).

Supply Nation Certification: Supply Nation is the leading directory of verified Indigenous businesses in Australia. Mokai is Supply Nation Certified, which is essentially the ticket to accessing IPP initiatives. Government buyers will typically verify a company’s Indigenous status via the Supply Nation database or a certificate. Mokai should ensure its Supply Nation profile is up to date and highlights its offerings. Being listed means agencies can confidently apply Exemption 16 or the set-aside, knowing Mokai meets the criteria (≥50% Indigenous ownership and an SME). Many agencies have internal procurement guidelines that say “if using Exemption 16, you must obtain a copy of the supplier’s Supply Nation certification” – so Mokai should be ready to provide that on request. Moreover, beyond federal, many state governments and even corporates look at Supply Nation for finding Indigenous suppliers as part of their own Reconciliation Action Plans (RAPs). Thus, this certification not only opens the federal IPP door but also opportunities in the corporate and state government sectors which have parallel Indigenous procurement targets.

Ease and Speed of Procurement: From an agency perspective, engaging a traditional (non-Indigenous) supplier for a significant purchase often requires a competitive tender or quoting process (to satisfy probity and CPRs). This can take weeks or months (writing requirements, publishing RFTs, evaluating bids, etc.), and it carries risk of challenges or delays. In contrast, using IPP Exemption 16 can be dramatically faster and lower-effort. The National Indigenous Australians Agency (which oversees the IPP) explicitly notes that *“procuring from an Indigenous-owned business is the easiest and fastest way for Federal Government departments to procure goods or services”*. An agency can literally get one quote from Mokai, evaluate it, and if it’s acceptable, go straight to contract award – no public tender needed. This agility is particularly valuable for urgent needs or end-of-financial-year spend, where time is short. Mokai can market itself to government clients as a “low-friction procurement route” – by choosing Mokai under Exemption 16, an agency can fulfill its requirement quickly and tick an Indigenous procurement box (helping them meet their annual IPP targets).

Value for Money (VFM) Considerations: While IPP allows bypassing competition, agencies still must ensure they pay a fair price. In practice, an agency might ask Mokai for a quote and also do a quick market check (like see a previous contract price or ask a non-Indigenous supplier informally for a budgetary quote) to validate Mokai’s pricing. Mokai should be prepared to demonstrate VFM – for example, by showing the discount off RRP it’s giving, or by highlighting any additional value (support, training) included. Fortunately, since software pricing is often standardized by vendors, Mokai can easily benchmark. If the vendor sells the license at a standard government rate, Mokai can quote that same rate – the agency then sees it’s getting the standard market price, which satisfies VFM. Mokai might even sometimes slightly undercut standard pricing (using a bit of its margin) to give confidence of a good deal. The IPP doesn’t require multiple quotes (no “3 quotes” rule when using Exemption 16, per policy FAQ), but some procurement officers do it out of habit. Mokai should not be alarmed if an agency asks, “Can you show that this is in line with what others charge?” – that’s easily handled via vendor price lists or historical prices.

Government Panels and Marketplaces: Apart from IPP-specific paths, there are established procurement arrangements for ICT:

Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) Panels: The DTA has coordinated procurement panels like the Cloud Marketplace and Software Marketplace (and the new Digital Marketplace Panel combining them). These are essentially pre-qualified seller lists for common ICT purchases. All federal agencies (and even state/local) can use them. Vendors and resellers get onto these panels via tender processes. For example, the Software Marketplace panel allows agencies to buy commercial off-the-shelf software easily from approved sellers. There are categories for different software types (ERP, cyber, etc.). Many big resellers (Data#3, SoftwareOne, etc.) are on these panels, and often particular vendors have only a few licensed resellers on them.

For Mokai, being on such panels can be advantageous for discoverability. However, note that panels are not mandatory if using Exemption 16. In fact, the Department of Finance explicitly states that panel arrangements do not override the CPRs and exemptions – agencies can still go direct to an Indigenous SME even if a panel exists. This was echoed by Kirra Services (another Indigenous IT supplier) saying *“Cooperative procurement arrangements are optional so Exemption 16 and the Mandatory Set Aside can be used for any goods or services listed. E.g. software.”*. In other words, even if there’s a whole-of-government software panel with big suppliers, an agency can opt to procure via Mokai under IPP without using the panel. This is a crucial point: Mokai isn’t barred from opportunities just because it’s not on certain panels.

That said, joining relevant panels is still a good idea for the long term. It provides additional avenues to receive work (some agencies may prefer to stick to panel lists). Mokai should consider applying to panels like the DTA Software Marketplace when they refresh or open (these panels periodically refresh membership). Also, state governments have their own panels (e.g. NSW ICT Services Scheme, VIC eServices panel) – most of which also have mechanisms for Indigenous suppliers or at least allow direct approach for certain spends. Mokai’s Indigenous status can sometimes get fast-tracked onto panels or at least meet social procurement criteria in those jurisdictions.


Departmental Panels and Standing Offers: Some agencies have specific panels (e.g. Defence has an ICT provider panel, some large departments have panels for software licensing). While panels usually involve multiple suppliers competing on mini-quotes, if Mokai is on the panel and is Indigenous, the agency could still choose Mokai directly citing IPP. Even outside of IPP, being on panels puts Mokai in the pool for routine quote requests, which is valuable deal flow. Mokai should identify major software procurement panels and seek inclusion if feasible.

Digital Marketplace (Services): Not to be confused with the Software Marketplace, the “Digital Marketplace” is a DTA platform for procuring digital services (like agile development, consulting) and has a strong SME/Indigenous inclusion focus. Mokai’s consulting and cybersecurity services could be offered through that platform. It’s worth registering on the Digital Marketplace to be visible for service contracts and to further establish government procurement credentials.


Indigenous Procurement Performance: The impact of IPP in recent years has been significant. Since reforms in 2015, Indigenous businesses have won thousands of contracts. A stat from late 2022-23 indicated that *almost 600 contracts have been awarded to Indigenous SMEs through the DTA’s digital, hardware, and software marketplaces, with a 1300% increase in contracted value from 2018-19 ($13M) to date ($188M)*. This meteoric increase shows agencies are increasingly utilizing these channels to meet their Indigenous spend targets. Mokai can cite such examples to clients as evidence that “others are doing it, it’s accepted practice.” In particular, some departments have embraced IPP strongly (Defence, Services Australia, Home Affairs, etc., have high targets and have let sizable direct contracts).

IPP in Practice – Positioning Mokai: To position itself, Mokai should:

Emphasize its Supply Nation certified Indigenous status in all capability statements and proposals to government. Make it front and center: agencies looking to meet their KPIs will immediately take note.

Highlight the procurement efficiency: e.g. “Engaging Mokai under the Indigenous Procurement Policy Exemption 16 allows your agency to secure the software you need in days, not months, with a compliant and auditable process.” Essentially, sell the convenience and speed.

Ensure all documentation is ready: often for a direct engagement, the agency might need a short “Value for Money memo” internally. Mokai can assist by providing a quote that clearly details the offering and pricing rationale, making it easy for the procurement officer to justify. Including a comparison to a list price or a previous contract price can clinch the VFM argument. Mokai might say, “Our price is per standard vendor government pricing; as comparison, [Competitor] sold a similar license to Dept X for $Y last year – we are in line with that, ensuring value for money.” This proactive stance builds trust.

Leverage Exemption 16 beyond federal: Note that state governments have analogous policies (e.g. NSW has an Aboriginal Procurement Policy with certain set-asides). While they don’t have exactly Exemption 16, they often allow limited tenders or direct negotiations for Indigenous suppliers under certain thresholds. Mokai’s federal Supply Nation status is usually recognized in states too. Additionally, many corporate and multinational companies have supplier diversity programs; Mokai can similarly position as a low-friction way for corporates to meet their RAP commitments by sourcing software through an Indigenous supplier (though corporate procurement is less standardized, many have internal goals like “X% of spend to Indigenous vendors”).


Risk of Panel “lock-out”: One challenge noted in the industry (as per Kieran Hynes of Willyama Services) is that some procurement officers over-rely on panels and ignore exemptions, effectively “weaponising” panels to exclude SMEs or Indigenous firms. Mokai might encounter public servants who say, “We have to buy via our panel provider (e.g. Data#3 or another LSP).” In such cases, Mokai can respectfully educate or seek higher-level support by pointing out the CPRs: Panels are meant to be a convenient option, not mandatory if an exemption applies. Exemption 16 is a valid alternative path that even supersedes panel mandates. Oftentimes, procurement leadership in agencies are aware of this and encourage using Indigenous suppliers, but some lower-level officers play it safe with status quo. Mokai should be prepared to navigate this by providing information, or involving the agency’s Supplier Diversity Champion or procurement policy unit who can approve the exemption usage. The key message: using Mokai is fully compliant and helps the agency meet policy goals, even if a panel exists.

Other Procurement Factors: Government buyers will also consider other compliance items when engaging Mokai:

Insurance requirements: Typically, federal contracts require certain insurance coverage (Public Liability often $10–20 million, Professional Indemnity in ICT maybe $5 million, Workers Comp as required by law). Mokai should have these or be ready to obtain them. These are standard and show capability to handle risk.

Security clearances or security vetting: If Mokai’s work is just reselling software, it usually doesn’t require staff with security clearances. However, if providing on-site services or handling sensitive data, certain projects (especially in Defence or intelligence agencies) might require baseline security clearance for staff. Mokai should be aware of this and can have staff go through clearance if targeting those areas.

Data sovereignty and cloud policies: When reselling cloud software to government, agencies may ask about data residency and IRAP certification, etc. While Mokai doesn’t control the software, it should be knowledgeable about the vendor’s compliance (e.g. Microsoft Azure/AWS are ASD certified for PROTECTED data, etc.). Being able to speak to these points reinforces Mokai’s credibility as a supplier to government.

Reporting: Under IPP, agencies report their Indigenous spend. Mokai may be asked to provide info for reporting (like confirming its Indigenous ownership, which is straightforward via Supply Nation). There might also be contracts that include Indigenous participation clauses (for very large projects, the Mandatory Minimum Requirements if >$7.5M in certain sectors). If Mokai is prime, it inherently fulfills Indigenous participation by being Indigenous-owned, which is a bonus.



In summary, the regulatory landscape strongly favours Mokai’s inclusion in government procurement thanks to the IPP. By harnessing Exemption 16, Mokai can transform what would normally be a tough competitive market into a relatively blue ocean, provided it offers competitive pricing and professional delivery. Mokai’s strategy should treat the IPP not as an entitlement, but as an entry ticket – once in, Mokai still must deliver value, but the policy removes many barriers to entry. The combination of being Supply Nation certified, understanding procurement processes, and pitching the ease of doing business with an Indigenous SME positions Mokai as an attractive procurement choice for agencies looking for both ICT solutions and a way to meet their diversity targets.

5. Competitive Positioning & Differentiation

Mokai Technologies operates in a market alongside large, established IT providers and distributors. To succeed, Mokai must leverage its unique strengths – notably its Indigenous ownership and agility – while mitigating challenges of scale and recognition. Here we compare Mokai’s model to traditional players and identify how Mokai can differentiate itself, especially in the eyes of vendors and customers who value ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) outcomes and Indigenous engagement:

Traditional Competitors: In the software resale and integration space, Mokai’s competition includes:

Tier-1 Distributors (e.g. Dicker Data, Ingram Micro) – These firms usually do not sell directly to end-customers (their business is supplying resellers), so they aren’t competitors in bidding to government; rather, they could be suppliers/partners to Mokai. However, sometimes a distributor might have a services arm or do fulfillment on large contracts (especially if no reseller is attached). Generally, though, Mokai can view them as allies for credit and logistics. The bigger picture is that distributors have enormous scale and efficiency – Dicker Data’s revenues exceed A$2 billion and it carries almost every major vendor, serving thousands of partners. What Mokai cannot match here in scale, it doesn’t need to – Mokai should utilize distributors for backend support while it focuses on front-end relationships.

Large Value-Added Resellers / Systems Integrators – This includes companies like Data#3, DXC, IBM Australia, Accenture, Insight, Computer Alliance, etc., and specialized software resellers like SoftwareOne, Artic Consulting or others depending on the product. These companies often hold top-tier vendor partnerships (e.g. Data#3 is a Microsoft LSP and Gold partner, etc.) and have decades-long relationships in government. Data#3, for example, is one of the biggest Microsoft licensing providers for Australian government with record sales in FY24. Such firms have advantages of scale: large sales teams, pre-existing panel contracts, and the ability to offer a one-stop-shop (hardware, software, services bundled).

IT Distributors acting as Service Providers – Some distributors like Dicker Data and Ingram have cloud marketplaces and even government aggregation deals (e.g. Dicker Data has federal government business through its resellers). While they usually won’t appear client-facing, it’s worth noting that if Mokai doesn’t step in, agencies might just default to buying through a panel provider or even through a distributor’s fulfillment mechanism. For example, whole-of-government Microsoft contracts often designate a primary reseller (like Data#3 or DXC) to manage the enterprise agreement, cutting out others for those particular products.


Mokai’s Indigenous-Owned, Direct-Sourcing Model: Mokai’s differentiators include:

Indigenous Procurement Access: As discussed, Mokai can be a direct source under IPP rules. Traditional competitors who are not Indigenous (like Data#3, IBM, etc.) must compete via tenders or panels, which is slower and less certain for the client. Mokai can legitimately say, “We can get this done for you quickly under a valid exemption.” This is a huge advantage in the public sector environment. Competitors may have to wait for an RFP to be released and then fight over price; Mokai can short-circuit that process. In essence, Mokai’s pipeline can include deals that others never even hear about because the agency can directly engage Mokai. That “lack of friction” is golden to busy procurement officers. None of the major non-Indigenous SIs can offer that.

Flexibility and Agility: Being a lean, smaller company, Mokai can provide flexible terms and personalized service in ways big firms might not. For example, a massive integrator might have rigid policies on deal size or support; Mokai can go the extra mile (like offering slightly customized billing cycles, hands-on support during product trials, etc.). Anecdotally, smaller providers often win loyalty by being more responsive and tailoring their approach – something a big competitor with layers of management might struggle with. Mokai can position as “the responsive local partner”, which appeals to clients frustrated with bureaucratic large vendors.

Lower Overheads – Potential Price Advantage: Large SIs carry big overhead (large offices, many staff). Mokai, as a lean outfit, can operate with lower overhead costs. This means Mokai could potentially accept slightly lower margins on a deal and still be profitable, where a bigger competitor might not budge due to their cost structure. Mokai shouldn’t always compete on price, but having that option to be very competitive when needed is useful. For example, if a deal does require multiple quotes, Mokai might be able to undercut a company like Data#3 by a few percentage points and still make money, especially if Mokai leverages its vendor incentives. In scenarios where IPP isn’t invoked and Mokai has to bid, this cost agility is an edge.

Indigenous Ownership = ESG Benefit: Many government agencies and corporate clients have Reconciliation Action Plans (RAPs) or ESG goals that include engaging Indigenous suppliers. Mokai offers a “two-for-one” value: not only do they get a quality IT product/service, but they also advance their social procurement objectives. This is a differentiation that traditional competitors can’t match – they might have RAPs pledging to subcontract or mentor Indigenous businesses, but they themselves are not Indigenous-owned. Mokai is the target outcome of those initiatives. In marketing, Mokai can highlight success stories where its involvement helped an agency meet procurement targets. For instance, if Agency X needed to improve its Indigenous spend percentage and by awarding a contract to Mokai they did, that’s a powerful testimonial.

Cultural Alignment and Community Impact: Mokai, by virtue of being Indigenous-owned, can connect with certain community and cultural perspectives that others may not. For agencies working closely with Indigenous communities or focusing on closing the gap (health, education departments, etc.), partnering with an Indigenous tech firm brings cultural insights and a level of representation. This might not be a daily factor in software reselling, but it builds goodwill. Also, vendors themselves increasingly value partners who contribute to diversity and community. For example, OpenText’s channel manager in ANZ stressed the “importance of cultural alignment and mutual business objectives” when partnering with Indigenous MSP Yirigaa. Vendors see that an Indigenous partner like Mokai can enhance their own reputation and reach.

Moreover, Mokai can differentiate by telling its story – being Indigenous-owned and perhaps highlighting any community give-back or training initiatives it has (or plans to have). Many big competitors can only talk about CSR in abstract, whereas Mokai can present itself as living proof of positive social impact (e.g. employing Indigenous staff, mentoring interns, etc.). This narrative appeals both to customers (especially government, which is under pressure to show social value from spending) and to vendors (who have their partner diversity metrics).


Sole-Source Plus Services: Mokai not only can sell software, but also provide consulting services around it (cybersecurity and compliance). Traditional resellers might also offer services, but Mokai’s consulting arm can be a differentiator if it’s nimble. For instance, Mokai could bundle a small “configuration and training” service with a software sale, making the offer more compelling and integrated. A competitor might need to bring in separate teams or may not bother with small training gigs, whereas Mokai could say “you buy Atlassian licenses from us, we’ll include a day of admin training for your team.” This value-add differentiates Mokai as a full solution provider, not just a license seller.


Constraints and Challenges for Mokai:

Scale and Capacity: Mokai’s smaller size means it has fewer personnel and limited capacity to handle very large or multiple simultaneous projects compared to, say, an Accenture. A big competitor can throw a team of 10 at a deployment if needed; Mokai might have 2-3 available. This could be a concern for some clients. Mokai should mitigate this by careful scope management (don’t over-commit to services beyond capacity) and by partnering or subcontracting where appropriate. It might collaborate with other Indigenous SMEs or sympathetic larger firms if a project demands it. For pure reselling, scale matters less except in support – e.g., ensuring someone is always available to answer client queries even if the team is small.

Vendor Tier Thresholds: As noted, bigger competitors hold higher-tier partnerships which afford them better pricing or rebates. In competitive deals, they might use that advantage to out-discount a newcomer. For instance, a Platinum partner could afford to give away more margin and still break even because they get backend rebates, whereas Mokai at a starter tier might not. We’ve seen Atlassian partners mention that “there are partners who give away their whole margin to the customer” just to make the sale and keep their volumes. A large reseller can sometimes sell at near zero margin on product because they make money on volume rebates or attached services. Mokai must be cautious in such price wars. The IPP advantage is one way to circumvent direct competition, but if Mokai is in a contest, it should leverage any vendor support it can – e.g. request deal-specific discounts from the vendor to level the playing field. Vendors often will help new partners win a flagship customer if asked, especially if it aligns with diversity goals.

Vendor Recognition and Support: Big partners are well-known to vendors; they have dedicated channel managers and can escalate issues quickly. Mokai as a newcomer will need to build credibility with vendors from scratch. At first, Mokai may not get top-of-mind attention from, say, Microsoft’s partner team which is busy with Gold partners. To overcome this, Mokai should proactively engage vendor contacts, highlight any quick wins it achieves, and use its differentiator: vendors are often very keen to showcase successful Indigenous partners as part of their own narrative. For example, CrowdStrike proudly announced Baidam Solutions as its first Indigenous partner and praised its contributions. Mokai can seek similar spotlight by collaborating on case studies or press releases when it closes a notable deal. That raises Mokai’s profile in the vendor’s eyes and can accelerate getting to higher partner tiers or receiving co-selling opportunities.

Financial Resources: Small businesses can face constraints in funding large transactions (as discussed in Section 3). While not visible to clients, it affects competitive positioning because a large competitor can easily finance a $5M software deal (they have big credit facilities), whereas Mokai might be strained by a sudden large order. If a client senses that a supplier might have financial difficulty handling a contract, it could cause doubt. Mokai should shore up its financial image – e.g., secure a good credit line, possibly get trade insurance, and always communicate confidence in fulfilling orders of any size (“we have distribution partners and financial arrangements to deliver even the largest projects”). This will assure vendors and clients that Mokai can punch above its weight.

Reputation and Track Record: Incumbent players have decades of references; Mokai is new and needs to establish trust. In government, reputation is crucial. Mokai will need to build a track record of successful deliveries (even small ones) and gather client testimonials. Being Indigenous-owned gets one in the door, but consistent performance keeps one there. Any missteps could be magnified (“see, we tried an SME and they failed…”). So Mokai must be diligent in execution and customer satisfaction. Over time, each win (especially with well-known agencies) will narrow the credibility gap with larger competitors.


How Mokai Can Stand Out to Vendors (ESG and Indigenous Supplier Metrics): It’s not just customers that care about ESG; vendors themselves have corporate social responsibility programs and often have internal goals to foster diversity in their channel. Many global tech companies – Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Cisco – have initiatives to support Indigenous businesses and other underrepresented groups. For example, Microsoft Australia’s Reconciliation Action Plan outlines commitments to working with Indigenous suppliers and includes partnering with Supply Nation to diversify its vendor network. When Mokai engages with such vendors, it should:

Highlight Shared Values: Make it known that by partnering with Mokai, the vendor is furthering its own diversity and inclusion goals. For instance, Mokai could be part of Microsoft’s “Social Impact” partner stories or Cisco’s programs for Indigenous communities. Cisco Australia in 2020s has run programs focusing on Indigenous training (e.g., Cisco’s Push for digital skills in Aboriginal communities). If Mokai also invests in community (like offering internships to Indigenous youth in tech), it becomes a partner that vendors are proud to support and showcase. CrowdStrike’s endorsement of Baidam was explicitly because Baidam not only sold security but also funded scholarships for Indigenous students. Mokai can pursue a similar strategy – emphasize any give-back program, however modest, to be that “perfect partner for both our products and our values” in a vendor’s eyes.

Offer a Unique Go-to-Market Angle: Vendors want partners who bring something unique. Mokai’s uniqueness could be its access to government via IPP. Mokai can say to a vendor, “We can help you crack into Agency X or the public sector easier because of our status.” This is particularly attractive to smaller or fast-growing vendors (e.g., a security software startup) that don’t have much penetration in government. If Mokai positions itself as the Indigenous channel partner that can get your product into new government accounts, that is a compelling pitch to a vendor. It’s essentially offering a shortcut to sales that the vendor or a non-Indigenous partner might struggle to unlock due to procurement barriers.

Demonstrate Competence and Reliability: Ultimately, vendors won’t work with Mokai just out of charity or quota-filling; Mokai needs to show it has the technical and sales capability to represent their brand well. Achieving relevant certifications, building a skilled team, and delivering on initial opportunities will prove to vendors that Mokai is not just a “diversity tick” but a solid channel ally. Once that trust is built, vendors may feed more leads or invest more in Mokai (through MDF, joint marketing).

Leverage Vendor ESG Programs: Some vendors have formal programs for underrepresented partners. For example, Microsoft’s global program “#BuildFor2030” or others might highlight partner solutions with social impact. There are also often awards (like at vendor partner conferences) for diversity excellence. Mokai should aim to be visible in those spheres – it differentiates from competitors who might be great at sales but can’t win an “Inclusion Champion” award. Dicker Data, for instance, won a “Diversity & Inclusion Champion” award in the channel, but as a distributor enabling others. Mokai could directly personify diversity in the channel.


Competitive Messaging: When facing off against a traditional competitor in a deal (or simply in marketing to customers), Mokai can craft a narrative:

“Unlike large generic providers, Mokai is an agile Indigenous-owned firm that offers the same leading software solutions with unmatched procurement ease and a commitment to community impact. With Mokai, your purchase not only meets your IT needs but also contributes to Indigenous economic empowerment as per government policy objectives.”

Mokai can point out that working with them still gives access to all the top technologies (since Mokai partners with the same vendors) but with the bonus of personalized service and societal benefit.

For government audiences, emphasize Mokai’s knowledge of government process combined with its IPP status: e.g., “We understand government ICT requirements and are Supply Nation certified – which means we can deliver outcomes faster under IPP provisions and help your department reach its Indigenous procurement targets with zero compromise on quality or cost.”


Turning Constraints into Collaborations: One strategy to handle scale constraints is to partner with larger companies rather than always compete. For example, sometimes a big SI might need an Indigenous partner to meet client expectations or contractual requirements (some government RFPs require an Indigenous engagement plan). Mokai could position itself as a partner of choice for subcontracting or consortium bids. This way, Mokai can get pieces of larger projects. While this means sharing revenue, it can be a win-win: the big player meets their RAP commitment by subbing to Mokai; Mokai gains experience and revenue. Over time, Mokai can parlay that into direct prime contracts. Essentially, Mokai could be a specialist or niche collaborator (e.g., providing Indigenous-led cybersecurity consulting on a larger contract). This strategy has been used by firms like Willyama and others to grow initially.


In conclusion, Mokai’s competitive strategy should double down on what makes it different, not what makes it the same. It cannot outspend or outsize the giants, but it can outmaneuver them in the government arena by using Indigenous procurement pathways, and it can appeal to the values that increasingly matter to clients and vendors. By being excellent in execution and vocal about its unique value proposition, Mokai can carve a distinct brand in the market – one associated with trust, social value, and technical competence. This positions Mokai not just as another reseller, but as a partner of choice for forward-thinking customers and vendors alike.

6. Implementation Blueprint

To operationalize all of the above and become a successful reseller, Mokai needs a clear step-by-step plan. Below is a blueprint covering how to get started with vendor partnerships, set up the business infrastructure, and engage government clients under IPP rules. This roadmap is broken into key steps with practical actions:

1. Establish Vendor Partnerships and Distributor Agreements

Identify Target Vendors & Programs: Make a list of the key software vendors Mokai wants to resell (e.g. Microsoft, Atlassian, CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Tenable, etc. as mentioned). Visit each vendor’s official partner portal or partner program page. For instance, go to Microsoft Partner Network (now “Microsoft Cloud Partner Program”), Atlassian Partner Program, CrowdStrike Accelerate Partner Program, etc. and review the requirements and benefits.

Online Application/Registration: Most programs allow online sign-up. Complete the applications with accurate company details (ABN, company size, areas of expertise). Emphasize any credentials (even if minimal at start, e.g. “Mokai has cybersecurity consulting expertise” in the narrative sections).

Use Distributor Onboarding for Major Vendors: For vendors that require a distribution channel (like Microsoft CSP or certain security vendors that only sell through distys), reach out and set up accounts with key distributors. For example:

Contact Dicker Data and TD Synnex – these are two major distributors covering Microsoft, security products, etc. Request to become a reseller partner. They will have a reseller application form (which asks for business details, trade references, etc.). Given Mokai is a new company, they may start with a modest credit limit until payment history is built. If possible, meet a rep in person or via call – explain Mokai’s business model and Indigenous status (distributors may offer support or introductions in light of that).

For cloud licenses (Microsoft 365, Azure), an indirect CSP arrangement is needed. Dicker Data, Rhipe (now part of Crayon), or Ingram Micro Cloud can serve. Sign the reseller agreement with the chosen Cloud Distributor. They’ll provide access to a portal (e.g. Microsoft Partner Center via their agency) where Mokai can provision licenses for clients.

If certain security vendors (CrowdStrike, SentinelOne) operate through master distributors in ANZ (for example, CrowdStrike partnered with Dicker Data as a distributor in Australia), leverage that. After signing up with Dicker, specifically inform them “We are interested in selling CrowdStrike and SentinelOne – can you connect us with those vendor channel managers or get us authorized?” Distributors often facilitate introductions to vendor representatives for new partners.


Initial Certifications & Training: Upon joining each program, schedule the recommended training. For Microsoft, enroll in fundamental courses (e.g. Azure Fundamentals, etc.) which are often free. Atlassian might require completing sales accreditations online. CrowdStrike and similar will have partner training portals – ensure at least one team member completes sales 101 and technical fundamentals for each product line. This not only increases product knowledge but also shows the vendor Mokai is active.

Leverage Indigenous Angle in Onboarding: When speaking with vendor channel managers or distributor reps, highlight that Mokai is Supply Nation certified. Ask if the vendor has any “Indigenous Partner” initiatives or if they can feature Mokai in their internal newsletters as a new Indigenous partner. Many will be enthusiastic as it adds diversity to their ecosystem. This can sometimes result in expedited approvals or even waived program fees. For example, if Microsoft required a competency fee, they might waive or defer it as part of an inclusion effort (Microsoft’s Partner for Purpose program encourages working with Indigenous businesses).

Set Revenue Goals & Tier Plan: Work with each vendor (via their partner account manager, once assigned) to set realistic short-term goals. E.g., tell CrowdStrike “our plan is to close 2 deals in government in the next 12 months.” They might offer extra support like joint sales calls or demo licenses. Similarly, for Microsoft, decide if Mokai will pursue Microsoft’s new Solutions Partner designation in a certain area (e.g. Azure or Security); map out the requirements (exams, customer additions) and start working on them. This keeps Mokai on a path to advance tiers (Silver/Gold or equivalent) within 1-2 years.


2. Negotiate Margins, Pricing, and Rebates

Understand Pricing Structures: Upon onboarding, obtain the partner price lists or margin information from each source. For example, Microsoft’s distributor will provide a discount rate for CSP licenses. Atlassian’s program will inform the discount off Atlassian list prices for each tier. Document these so you know, for instance, Atlassian = 20% off (Platinum) or 15% off (Gold) etc., Microsoft CSP via Dicker = ~15% off MSRP, CrowdStrike = case-by-case quotes (often ~20% margin). Knowing the baseline margin helps in making competitive quotes and seeing where negotiation is possible.

Discuss Margin Opportunities with Distributors: Distributors often have flexible margin programs. For cloud subscriptions, the margin might be fixed, but for one-time licenses or large deals, you can negotiate deal-specific discounts. Initiate a conversation: “If I have a government deal for 500 users of X software, can you offer better pricing than standard?” Distributors might say yes if it’s large volume, as they can request a vendor special bid price. Also inquire about growth rebate programs – e.g., some distributors give a rebate if you exceed a quarterly sales threshold with them.

Deal Registration & Special Pricing: Whenever pursuing a significant opportunity, use the vendor’s deal registration process early. Registering a deal (say a 100-seat CrowdStrike sale at Dept Y) with the vendor can secure additional margin (often 5-10% extra discount protected for Mokai). Ensure you know how to register deals in each vendor’s partner portal or via the distributor.

Rebate Structures: Ask vendor reps about rebates: “Do you offer back-end rebates for revenue or new customer acquisition?” For example, Microsoft has incentive programs for CSP partners (like rebates on Azure consumption), and security vendors sometimes pay a rebate for each new license year one. If these exist, get clarity on percentages and conditions so you can factor them into pricing strategy. For instance, if you know you’ll get a 5% rebate, you might afford to give the client an extra 2% discount and still net 3% more later.

Negotiate Payment Terms if Needed: Especially with distributors, if Mokai anticipates cashflow tightness on big deals, negotiate terms. Many distributors start new partners on COD (cash on delivery) or low credit. Aim to secure at least 30-day credit terms. Provide trade references or personal guarantees if needed to build trust. Over a few good transactions, request increases in credit limit proportional to sales growth. A strong relationship with the distributor’s credit team is invaluable – communicate upcoming large deals so they are prepared to extend terms.

Vendor Incentive Programs: Sign up for any partner incentive programs for sales reps. For example, some vendors run spiffs: “Sell our product, and your sales rep gets a $100 gift card per deal” – these motivate the team. Also keep an eye on vendor promotions (like “Q4 bonus 2% rebate on all deals closed”). A proactive partner manager will inform Mokai, but Mokai should also regularly check partner portals for announcements.

Pricing Strategy: Develop a pricing approach for government clients:

Determine a standard margin target (say 10-15%) on most deals to keep the business sustainable.

But also decide on scenarios where you’d dip lower (e.g. to break into a strategic account or beat a competitor) versus when you’ll hold margin (e.g. when using IPP sole-source where no direct competition).

Be ready to justify pricing in terms of VFM rather than just low cost. Government buyers will accept a fair price if it comes with low risk and meets policy goals. So Mokai might not need to heavily discount in sole-source cases – focus on being in line with market.

For competitive quotes, use the intel from distributors about street pricing. They can tell you, “Typically this software sells at X% off list in competitive bids.” Ensure Mokai’s quote is in that ballpark or slightly better if you really want to win it.

Always factor in any cost of services if included. If Mokai is adding a day of consulting, include that cost and ensure overall margin accounts for it (sometimes it’s fine to do a small free service as goodwill, but larger efforts should be charged or clearly limited).



3. Set Up Financial Systems and Renewal Tracking

Accounting & Invoicing Setup: Implement a reliable accounting system (e.g. Xero, MYOB or QuickBooks) to manage quotes, invoices, and payments. Configure it with the proper tax settings (GST for Australian sales). This will ensure professional invoicing – critical for government clients (invoices should have ABN, GST breakdown, etc.). Also, set up electronic payment methods (bank transfer details on invoices). For larger government contracts, Mokai might need to register in their payment systems (e.g. some use electronic invoicing or procurement portals – be prepared to do that paperwork).

Cashflow Management: Prepare a simple cashflow projection for at least 6-12 months. Incorporate expected payment lags. For instance, assume government pays at 30-45 days. Plan for funding those 30-45 days for each expected deal. If short-term financing is needed, explore options like invoice financing (but be mindful of their fees). Ideally, reinvest early profits to build a buffer fund. Also consider setting aside GST from each payment so you don’t get caught short at BAS time.

Renewal Tracking System: Implement a CRM or at minimum a spreadsheet that lists every software license Mokai sells, with key dates: purchase date, contract term, renewal due date, and renewal notice period. Many vendors or distributors will send renewal reminders – e.g., 90 days out – but Mokai should not rely solely on them. For scale, a simple CRM like HubSpot (free tier) or an IT PSA tool (ConnectWise, etc.) could be used to manage renewals and even automate reminder emails. Initially, a well-structured Excel/Google Sheet could suffice:

Include columns for Client, Product, Quantity, Expiry Date, Renewal Value, etc.

Filter/sort by expiry date monthly to see what’s coming up.


Assign Responsibility: Decide who in the team handles renewals (e.g. an account manager or even the founder initially). The process should be: T-minus 90 days, reach out to client about renewal, confirm any changes (quantities, upgrades), get quote from vendor/distributor, and send proposal to client. Then follow up until PO is received. Starting early means if the client wants to explore alternatives, you have time to react (though with IPP, ideally they just stay with Mokai).

Recurring Revenue Accounting: Since a goal is building recurring revenue, set up the accounting system to distinguish one-time vs recurring. You might, for instance, use tracking categories in Xero to tag revenue as “New License Sale” vs “Renewal” vs “Services”. This will allow monitoring of how renewal revenue grows over time and ensure focus remains on retention.

Billing Cycles & Terms to Clients: Decide on standard payment terms for your clients. Government generally expects 30 days. Mokai can put 14 days on invoices, but realistically agencies will often take 30. For friendly agencies or smaller deals, you might get quicker. Make sure contracts or quotes clearly state the payment terms and any milestone (for large projects, if any). Given software is usually upfront annual, it will mostly be one invoice annually at start of period.

Monitor Vendor Bills: Likewise, keep a calendar of when payments to distributors/vendors are due. Missing a payment to a distributor can freeze your account and damage reputation. Set reminders a few days before due dates to ensure those are paid (or communicate if any issue – distributors can be understanding if informed in advance).

Scaling Finance and Admin: As Mokai grows, consider hiring or assigning a dedicated person (or part-time bookkeeper) to manage invoicing and collections. This ensures nothing falls through the cracks while you focus on sales and delivery.


4. Prepare Compliance Documents and Insurance

Insurance Coverage: Before bidding on or signing government contracts, have the necessary insurances in place:

Public Liability Insurance (PLI): Commonly required minimum is A$10 million coverage for ICT contracts (some agencies ask for $20m, but $10m is a usual baseline). This covers any third-party injury or property damage arising from your business (mostly relevant if doing on-site work, but it’s a standard requirement regardless).

Professional Indemnity Insurance (PI): For providing advice or services, PI is typically mandated. For government IT, the required amount might be between $1 million to $5 million depending on contract risk. To be safe, Mokai could carry $2 million or $5 million PI. This covers claims of negligence or errors in professional work (e.g. if consulting advice led to a loss).

Workers’ Compensation: As soon as Mokai has employees, by law it needs workers’ comp insurance in its operating state. Ensure this is arranged (it’s also often asked in tenders).

Product Liability: Often bundled with PLI or relevant if hardware is supplied. For pure software reselling, not typically separate; PLI should cover it.

Cyber Liability Insurance: Since Mokai is dealing in cybersecurity and software, consider a cyber insurance policy for itself – some clients may inquire about it to ensure you can handle data safely. It might not be explicitly required in contracts (sometimes it is now), but it’s a good risk management practice.

Once obtained, keep certificates of currency ready to provide to clients or panel applications.


Company Policies and Compliance Docs: Government procurement may require Mokai to have certain policies in place:

Workplace Health & Safety (WHS) Policy: A brief policy on commitment to safety (especially if doing on-site services).

Quality Management Process: Not ISO9001 per se, but some tender responses ask how you ensure quality. Mokai should at least have a documented process for project delivery and customer support.

Information Security Policy: If dealing with sensitive data, having an internal policy or even aiming for an ISO 27001 certification can be a selling point down the track (though not mandatory for just reselling licenses).

Ethical Procurement/Modern Slavery: Large companies and gov are conscious of supply chain ethics. Mokai might prepare a short statement on compliance with the Modern Slavery Act (if turnover is below $100m it’s not required, but having a stance doesn’t hurt).


Supply Nation Certificate: Ensure you have an up-to-date certificate or letter proving Supply Nation certification. Also, if any other Indigenous credentials (state registers, etc.), keep them on file.

IPP Knowledge: Familiarize yourself with the documentation that agencies might need for IPP. For example, some agencies may ask Mokai to fill out an Indigenous Business Self-Declaration (though Supply Nation cert is usually enough). Mokai should know IPP requirements enough to guide a client if they are unsure (like quoting the IPP guidelines that no additional quotes are needed beyond demonstrating VFM).

Register on Government Supplier Portals: Many agencies use systems like AusTender, Ariba, or specific portals to manage suppliers and RFPs. Register Mokai on relevant platforms:

AusTender (for federal tenders) – create an account so you can see opportunities and also get notifications in categories like ICT or Indigenous set-asides.

BuyICT (DTA Panel portal) – if aiming for panels, have an account ready and keep an eye on panel refresh opportunities.

State procurement systems (e.g. NSW eTendering, VIC VendorPanel, etc.) – register profiles there as an Indigenous supplier. Sometimes agencies search those for qualified suppliers.


Financial Statements: While not needed at the very start, as Mokai engages in larger contracts, agencies might request evidence of financial viability (especially if a big multi-year contract). Having basic financial statements (even if just an accountant-prepared summary for a small business) or letters of credit line from a bank can be useful. It pre-empts concerns about Mokai’s capacity to deliver.

Team Credentials: Ensure the team’s resumes and any certifications are up to date. Government often requires key personnel CVs in proposals. Mokai’s consultants should list their qualifications (e.g. CISSP or Azure certs). Emphasize any existing government security clearances if team members have them.


5. Structuring Sales & Procurement for Government (IPP-focused process)

Market Research & Networking: Identify target agencies that frequently buy software relevant to Mokai’s portfolio. Use publicly available info (AusTender contract notices, industry news) to see, for example, which departments use CrowdStrike, or which have Atlassian deployments. Focus on those agencies as potential clients. Leverage networks: attend government tech expos, join AIIA (Australian Information Industry Association) events, and specifically use Supply Nation networking events to meet government procurement officers. When introducing Mokai, highlight that agencies can use Exemption 16 to engage you – some may not be fully aware and will be pleased to learn it’s a viable route.

Early Engagement with Stakeholders: In a government sale, often the end user/IT team knows what they want (e.g. a certain software) and the procurement team handles the purchasing process. Mokai should be engaging both. That might mean: contact the IT security manager or CIO of Agency X to introduce Mokai’s capabilities in supplying (and supporting) a product they use or might need. Simultaneously, reach out to the procurement branch or Indigenous procurement champion in that agency to introduce Mokai as a Supply Nation supplier. Many departments have dedicated Indigenous procurement liaison officers – find them (often listed on agency websites or via LinkedIn) and inform them that Mokai stands ready to assist with software purchases under IPP. This two-pronged awareness ensures that when an opportunity arises, internal stakeholders know Mokai is available and procurement knows how to process it.

Value Proposition for Government: Develop a concise capability statement tailored to government. It should outline: Mokai’s services and the software brands it can supply, relevant gov experience (if any, or related experience), and importantly the IPP advantage (one section clearly stating: “Under the Indigenous Procurement Policy, Mokai can be engaged directly (Exemption 16) for any size contract. This provides a compliant, efficient procurement pathway – reducing tender costs and delays for your agency, while contributing to your IPP targets.”). Include the Supply Nation logo and certification info. Make this a PDF and share widely in meetings or via email.

Sales Cycle using Exemption 16: Here’s how Mokai can structure each opportunity:

1. Identify Need – through conversations or RFPs, find out an agency needs a software or service that Mokai can provide.


2. Position IPP Early – Immediately flag, if appropriate, that the requirement can be fulfilled by Mokai via IPP direct sourcing. Often if an RFP is already out, it’s too late unless it’s under threshold; better to catch needs before they go to open tender. This means staying close to customers and maybe even getting leads from vendors (“Vendor tells Mokai: Dept Y is interested in our product”). As soon as you know, propose to the department: “We can do this under a direct engagement – here’s why it’s beneficial to you.”


3. Scope and Quote – Work with the client to define exactly what they need (product SKUs, quantities, any support). Liaise with vendor/distributor to get the pricing. Prepare a formal quote/proposal on Mokai letterhead. This should include: itemized pricing, any services included, delivery timeline, and a statement on value for money (if not the cheapest, why still good value – e.g. product is unique, price is standard, etc.). Also mention compliance (we have the insurances, etc.). Essentially make it easy for the procurement officer to justify selecting Mokai. You may even attach a brief letter that says, “We understand you will be procuring under CPR Exemption 16 – as required, we confirm we are an Indigenous SME (Supply Nation certified) and believe this proposal represents value for money for the following reasons…”


4. Internal Agency Approval – The agency’s procurement will review and seek internal approvals (depending on size, could be the branch head, the CFO, etc.). Mokai should offer to assist with any info needed. Sometimes they might negotiate the price or terms at this stage – be prepared to perhaps sharpen the pencil if they show you a comparative benchmark. But often, if it’s within expected range, they’ll just proceed.


5. Contracting – Many agencies will use a simple contract or even a purchase order for the purchase. Since software supply is straightforward, they might use a standard ICT procurement contract (like the Department of Finance’s ICT procurement terms, or just Ts&Cs on the PO). Ensure to read any contract they send – check liability clauses, etc. If it’s a one-page PO referencing your quote, ensure your quote had any necessary terms (like license terms or support conditions). Usually, the end-user license agreement (EULA) of the software is implicitly accepted by the government, but sometimes they need a formal acceptance – coordinate with the vendor on that if needed (some large software have specific government licenses).


6. Delivery and Invoicing – Once formalities are done, place the order with the distributor/vendror, deliver license keys or account setup details to the client. Make sure to follow any reporting the agency might want (some want a brief progress email stating “licenses activated on X date”). Then send the invoice promptly to start the payment clock.


7. Follow-up – After delivery, ensure the client is satisfied, help with any activation issues, and remind them you’re there for support (if you have a support offering) or any questions. This sets stage for renewal and upsell later.



Leverage DTA Marketplaces if needed: If an agency is hesitant to do a direct exemption for a large amount (some procurement people are cautious on multimillion direct awards), an alternative is to use the DTA Software Marketplace panel but still sole-source via that panel. If Mokai is on that panel, the agency could simply choose Mokai from the panel and negotiate – panels often allow a “Select” method (direct selection) up to high values. The difference is just paperwork – using the panel’s contract template. Mokai should be open to whichever procurement avenue the client feels comfortable with. The end goal is the same: Mokai gets the deal without open tender.

Compliance with Government Procedures: When executing government contracts, be meticulous: deliver on time, on budget; adhere to any reporting or invoicing formats; maintain security of any access provided. Government clients will appreciate a vendor that doesn’t cause admin headaches. This reliability will make them more likely to engage you again and recommend you internally.

Account Management and Relationship Building: Post-sale, maintain the relationship. Check in periodically with clients (not just at renewal time) to see if needs are changing or if there are other areas Mokai can assist. Also continue to remind them of the ease of using you – e.g. “If any other software procurements come up, remember we can help you quickly under IPP.” Satisfied clients can become strong advocates; word-of-mouth within government circles (or case studies at conferences) can generate new leads for Mokai.


By following this blueprint, Mokai can systematically build up its reseller operations. It covers how to get authorized, secure competitive pricing, set up the internal machinery for sales and fulfillment, and navigate the government selling process in line with IPP benefits. Each step is about laying a foundation – initial heavy lifting in setup will pay off as transactions start flowing smoothly. This approach ensures that Mokai not only starts strong but is set up to scale responsibly and sustainably.

7. Risks & Lessons Learned

Entering the reseller business, especially as a new and growing company, comes with several risks and common pitfalls. By learning from industry experiences (including those of other Indigenous tech firms), Mokai can anticipate challenges and implement safeguards. Below is an overview of key risks, lessons from others, and mitigation strategies:

Cashflow and Financing Pitfalls: One of the most immediate risks for new resellers is cashflow mismatch. You might secure a big sale (which is great), but if you have to pay the distributor/vendor before your client pays you, you can end up in a cash crunch. Many small resellers have struggled or even gone under despite strong sales because of this timing issue. Lesson: Plan financing for growth. Don’t assume “sales = cash in bank” until you account for payment terms. Mokai should avoid taking on a deal so large that it cannot float the payment for at least one cycle. For instance, if an agency wants to place a $5 million order but insists on 60-day payment, ensure the distributor can extend 60-day credit or involve a financing partner. If that’s not feasible, consider requesting stage payments from the client (though government rarely does advance payments, it might do milestone payments for multi-part projects). Another tactic is negotiating with the vendor for direct invoicing to the client with a reseller fee to Mokai – not common, but some vendors have agency models that could reduce Mokai’s cashflow burden.

Additionally, avoid overextending credit to any single client beyond your comfort. Government is low risk in terms of default, but delays can happen. Keep some buffer reserve for operating expenses so the rest of your business isn’t jeopardized while waiting on one big invoice.

Case example: A small IT provider once sold a large volume of licenses to a government department but had not established sufficient credit; they maxed out personal funds to pay the supplier and nearly ran out of cash before the government finally paid on day 45. The lesson is to line up credit facilities before you’re in the deal. Mokai should cultivate a good relationship with its bank or use invoice financing strategically if needed.


Vendor Targets and Performance Pressure: Vendors often set sales targets or thresholds for partners, especially to maintain certain tier status or rebates. A common pitfall for new partners is overcommitting to targets or stretching to hit them at all costs. For example, Atlassian partners noted they must sell an ever-increasing amount to keep status, leading some to sacrifice margin entirely to push volume. Lesson: Don’t chase tier status at the expense of financial health. Mokai should aim for growth, but not by taking unprofitable deals solely to appease a vendor. If a vendor program requires, say, $250K sales to remain in a tier and Mokai is short, it might be tempting to buy some licenses for “internal use” or sell at zero margin to hit the number. Such tactics, while sometimes seen in the channel, can hurt cashflow and set bad precedent. Instead, communicate with the vendor – sometimes they grant exceptions or extensions if they see genuine effort and pipeline. It’s better to drop to a lower tier for a while than to incur losses.

Another angle: select vendors carefully. Don’t sign up for every vendor under the sun initially; focus on a manageable few. Each vendor will expect some mindshare and results. It’s a risk to spread too thin and then fail to meet all their expectations. It’s wiser to have a strong success story with 2-3 key vendors, which can then be used to onboard others later.

Pitfall in practice: Some smaller resellers have had partnerships revoked for not meeting minimums (especially in programs like Microsoft’s old direct CSP or some security vendor tiers). This can be abrupt. To mitigate, always have the distributor relationship as a backup – e.g., if Mokai ever lost a direct status, it could still source via disti to continue business. Diversification of sourcing options is healthy.


Renewals Mismanagement: As the recurring client base grows, a frequent pitfall is letting renewals slip through the cracks. Missing a renewal means lost revenue and could sour the client (if their service lapses). Another scenario is that a competitor might swoop in at renewal time and offer a better deal if Mokai is not actively managing the relationship. Lesson: Treat renewals with as much importance as new sales. Implement the tracking system as described, and perhaps even incentivize team members on renewals (many VARs give their account managers commission for renewal retention to ensure focus). Aim for a near-100% renewal rate by being proactive. If a client decides not to renew a product due to budget cuts or switching solutions, that’s one thing – but it should never be because Mokai forgot or didn’t respond in time.

Also, be aware of vendor direct-renewal attempts. Some SaaS vendors might contact the customer directly at renewal if no partner is active. To prevent this, maintain a good relationship so the client directs the vendor back to Mokai for any quotes.

A best practice is doing annual account reviews with clients – before renewal time, meet to discuss if the solution is meeting needs and pitch any upsell/cross-sell. This not only locks in the renewal but can increase value of the account.


Competition and Undercutting: Even with IPP advantages, Mokai will sometimes face competitive situations (e.g., when bidding for corporate clients or if a government agency still seeks multiple quotes for comfort). Large competitors may undercut pricing significantly to win – sometimes even selling at break-even or loss (considered a loss-leader strategy) to prevent a new entrant from getting a foothold. Lesson: Pick your battles and differentiate beyond price. Mokai shouldn’t try to match a suicidal discount from a big competitor that can afford it. Instead, highlight total value: the service, the quicker delivery, the Indigenous aspect, etc. If a customer is purely price-driven and doesn’t value those, that might not be a profitable customer for Mokai to pursue vigorously. In government, fortunately, most are not allowed to buy solely on price if using IPP – they have to consider value and policy objectives. But in open tenders, yes, price can dominate. Mokai should calculate a walk-away price for each deal (below which it’s not worth doing) and stick to it.

When facing aggressive competitors, one mitigation is to use vendor support: e.g., ask the vendor if they can provide additional discount to help Mokai win (vendors might prefer an Indigenous partner win a deal, for PR or diversity reasons, and quietly authorize an extra 5% discount to Mokai that others don’t get). This can neutralize some competitive edge.

Local example: Smaller Indigenous IT firms (like PSK Group or others) have sometimes lost on price in tenders, but won work by approaching it differently – e.g., via direct IPP instead of tender or focusing on deals where they had incumbency. So, where possible, shape the deal to your advantage (as discussed in Section 4, use direct sourcing rather than competing head-to-head).


Scaling and Quality Control: As Mokai grows its client base, delivering consistent quality and support is vital. A risk is over-promising – e.g., taking on a complex implementation project without sufficient skilled staff, leading to failures or delays. Lesson: Don’t compromise quality for rapid growth. It’s better to say no (or partner with someone) on a project outside your competence than to deliver a poor outcome. Government agencies talk to each other; a failed project would hurt reputation beyond that client.

Build slowly a knowledge base and support structure. For software resale, support might largely be handled by the vendor (especially for cloud services, vendors provide support directly to customers or via the partner). Ensure clear support arrangements: know when Mokai is level-1 support vs when it hands off to vendor. Manage client expectations on support (if Mokai is small, maybe offer support during business hours and rely on vendor’s 24/7 for critical issues if applicable).

Another lesson from others is to invest in staff – train them well and keep them. Losing a key engineer or sales person in early stages can set back momentum. Create a positive environment and perhaps highlight that employees are part of a bigger mission (Indigenous advancement, etc.), which can aid retention.


Case Studies & Community: A positive lesson from Indigenous firms like Baidam Solutions is that having a strong mission and community engagement can drive business indirectly. Baidam’s focus on training Indigenous youth in cyber gave them a unique story that attracted customers and vendors, essentially marketing by doing good. Mokai can consider how, once stable, it can create a similar virtuous cycle (e.g., offering internships or workshops for Indigenous students interested in tech). This is less a risk and more a missed opportunity if not pursued. It helps with talent pipeline and reputation.

Local success story: Another Indigenous IT company, Willyama Services, grew by securing Defence contracts under IPP and is now a known name in cyber. They advocated strongly for fair treatment in procurement (as seen in their submission, highlighting misuse of panels). A lesson from them is the importance of educating clients – Mokai should be ready to diplomatically educate any client who is unsure about using IPP or dealing with a smaller firm. By being knowledgeable, Mokai builds trust. Willyama also won awards, which boosted credibility. Mokai could target awards like Supply Nation’s Supplier of the Year or ARN Innovation Awards (there are categories for diversity). Recognition can mitigate the “small newcomer” perception.


Networking and Visibility: A hidden risk is staying too isolated. In the IT channel, relationships are everything – not just with customers, but with vendors and other partners. The more Mokai is involved in the community (attending industry events, giving talks, writing articles on Indigenous inclusion in tech), the more goodwill and referrals it will generate. Not doing so is a missed lesson. For example, joining groups like Indigenous ICT Industry Cluster (if exists) or being active on LinkedIn about your wins can draw attention in a good way.

Compliance and Governance: As Mokai executes contracts, ensure compliance with all contractual obligations. Government contracts often have clauses for reporting, invoicing format, privacy, etc. Small firms can sometimes slip up on an obscure requirement (like not submitting a contract performance report on time). These are minor but can affect past performance reviews. The lesson is to read contracts carefully and perhaps create a compliance checklist per contract. Also maintain transparency and ethical standards – any hint of improper practice could be disastrous given government scrutiny. Always deliver what was promised and communicate any issues early (e.g., if a vendor causes a delay in license delivery, inform the client rather than hoping it goes unnoticed).

Exit Strategy for Pitfalls: If something goes wrong – say a project is not going well – be ready to call in reinforcements (maybe hire a subcontractor or ask the vendor for extra help) rather than let it fail. Humility in course-correcting can save a client relationship. Government clients often will forgive a hiccup if handled openly and fixed, but they won’t forget a provider who hides problems or fails to rectify them.


Mitigations & Sustainable Growth:

To wrap up, here are concise strategies to mitigate risks and ensure sustainable growth:

Maintain a conservative financial posture: grow within means, secure credit early, and keep overhead low until recurring revenue is robust.

Institutionalize customer management: robust renewal tracking, regular check-ins, and customer satisfaction surveys to catch any service issues early.

Vendor alignment: keep vendors close – regular meetings with their channel managers to get feedback and support. If Mokai is struggling to meet something, be honest with the vendor; they may adjust expectations or assist (it’s in their interest that Mokai succeeds long-term).

Peer learning: Connect with other Indigenous business owners (through Supply Nation or chambers) to share lessons. There may be informal mentoring available. For example, if another Indigenous ICT company navigated similar hurdles, learn from them. The Indigenous business community is often supportive and can provide guidance unique to these circumstances.

Quality over quantity: Focus on doing excellent work for each client and growing organically through positive referrals, rather than rushing to win as many contracts as possible without ensuring you can deliver each well.

Plan for scale: Each year, revisit business processes and see if they can handle double the transactions – if not, tweak them. Invest in tools (CRM, automation) when manual effort becomes too much, so service quality doesn’t drop as volume increases.

Stay informed: Keep up with changes in procurement policy or vendor program updates (e.g., IPP targets evolving, or Microsoft changing partner requirements). Adapt strategies accordingly, so you’re never caught off-guard by an external change.


By internalizing these lessons and proactively managing the identified risks, Mokai can avoid the common pitfalls that trip up new entrants. In doing so, it sets a solid foundation for a business that is not only growing but is resilient and respected.

8. Strategic Summary for Mokai

What does Mokai need to understand, secure, and build to become a credible Indigenous software reseller in Australia?

Understanding: Mokai must deeply understand the dynamics of the Australian ICT channel and government procurement. This means recognizing how the vendor–distributor–reseller–client chain operates and where value is added at each step. Mokai should understand typical commercials (margins, rebates, pricing) in software reselling – e.g. knowing that software margins might range ~10-20% and that recurring revenue from renewals is key to long-term stability. Equally, Mokai should grasp the Indigenous Procurement Policy (IPP) framework thoroughly: the rules that allow agencies to bypass tenders to buy from Indigenous suppliers, and how Exemption 16 can be a game-changer, enabling direct contracts of any size with proper value-for-money justification. This understanding extends to knowing the government customer’s mindset – risk aversion, need for VFM, and increasing pressure to meet Indigenous procurement targets. By understanding both the market structure and the procurement rules, Mokai can align its strategy to take maximum advantage of them (for instance, targeting opportunities where it can be a sole-source provider under IPP, thereby avoiding head-to-head battles with bigger rivals).

Securing: Mokai needs to secure several critical assets:

Vendor Partnerships & Pricing Access: It must secure relationships with the right software vendors (e.g. Microsoft, Atlassian, cybersecurity vendors) by joining their partner programs and/or establishing distributor agreements. This will grant Mokai access to products at partner pricing and the support needed to sell them. For example, securing a partnership with Microsoft (via a CSP distributor) ensures Mokai can resell Microsoft cloud licenses with ~15% margin, and partnering with security vendors like CrowdStrike or SentinelOne will provide the credentials and training to deliver those solutions. These partnerships often come with partner tier achievements – Mokai should aim to secure at least entry-level certifications (demonstrating competence) and then progress to higher tiers to unlock better margins and vendor resources.

Financial Resources & Credit: Mokai must secure sufficient working capital or credit lines to support its deals. This means negotiating credit terms with distributors, and potentially securing a bank line of credit or trade finance, so that it can comfortably float the cost of software licenses until client payment arrives. Essentially, it needs to secure its cashflow – this financial stability is part of being credible in the eyes of large customers and vendors. A credible reseller can handle a $500K or $1M transaction without issue, and Mokai should take steps (like maintaining good financial statements, perhaps bringing on a financial advisor) to ensure it has that capacity.

Supply Nation Certification (Already in place): Mokai has its Supply Nation Indigenous business certification – that is a secured advantage that it should guard and leverage. Keeping that certification active and maintaining at least 50% Indigenous ownership and control is essential to retain the IPP privileges. (In practice, Mokai should also secure broader recognition by getting onto relevant government supplier lists and panels as opportunities arise.)

Trust and Support of Stakeholders: Credibility comes from trust. Mokai should secure early wins with a few reference clients – even small projects – and turn them into case studies or testimonials. Internally, it should secure the buy-in of vendor account managers and distributor reps, so that these stakeholders view Mokai as a serious and reliable partner (not just a diversity token). This might mean delivering on promises, communicating proactively, and possibly securing a vendor sponsor who can champion Mokai (for example, someone in Microsoft who is excited about an Indigenous partner and helps Mokai navigate the ecosystem).

Insurance and Compliance Credentials: To be truly credible in government eyes, Mokai needs to have all its compliance ducks in a row – secure the required insurances (public liability, professional indemnity, etc.), and any needed certifications (for instance, if down the line ISO certifications or DISP membership for Defence projects become relevant, those could be pursued). It’s about de-risking Mokai as a supplier so clients feel secure engaging with it for critical software needs.


Building: Mokai should focus on building a robust operational foundation and a compelling value proposition:

Build a Recurring Revenue Base: The goal is a stable, recurring revenue stream from software renewals and subscriptions. Mokai should build processes (CRM systems, renewal calendars) and customer relationships that ensure high renewal rates. Over time, this base of renewals (say, hundreds of licenses renewing annually) will give Mokai financial stability and credibility (because it demonstrates stickiness). For example, building up $X in annual recurring revenue from Microsoft 365 or Atlassian renewals can underpin growth.

Build Internal Capabilities and Team Expertise: Invest in staff training and certifications to build technical credibility. Mokai’s team should include certified professionals (e.g. Microsoft Certified, Atlassian accredited, cyber certifications) so clients and vendors see that Mokai has the knowledge to support the products it sells. Building this human capital will differentiate Mokai from resellers that are just “box-pushers.” Additionally, Mokai can build out its service offerings around the software (e.g. implementation, basic support), which both increases revenue and cements client trust.

Build a Strong Service Delivery Framework: Even if reselling is the core, having a basic ITIL-style service desk or account management practice is valuable. Mokai should build a reputation for reliability – deliver licenses on time, respond quickly to client inquiries, and resolve issues efficiently. This might mean developing standard operating procedures (SOPs) for things like processing orders, handling support tickets, and engaging vendor support. Consistency in execution builds credibility fast, especially in tight-knit government circles where positive feedback can spread.

Build Partnerships and Alliances: Beyond vendor ties, Mokai can build alliances with complementary firms – for example, other Indigenous businesses or niche tech providers – to punch above its weight. If Mokai builds a network where it can call on other experts or be called upon (for instance, a large SI might bring Mokai in to fulfill the Indigenous component of a project), it extends Mokai’s reach. Building an ecosystem presence (through industry associations like AIIA, attending ARN awards, etc.) will make Mokai a known quantity in the channel.

Build Market Awareness of Mokai’s Indigenous Advantage: This is more about building the brand and sales pipeline. Mokai should actively market itself as the go-to Indigenous supplier for software and cybersecurity solutions. This could involve content marketing (blog posts about Indigenous success in ICT), speaking at procurement or IT conferences about the IPP (positioning Mokai as thought leaders in how government can innovate procurement), and targeted outreach to CIOs/procurement heads about the ease of engaging Mokai. Building this thought leadership and brand will amplify the pull for Mokai’s services.

Build a Sustainable Growth Strategy: Rather than chasing quick wins only, Mokai should build a client portfolio that is diversified (across multiple agencies and also enterprise clients perhaps) and plan for steady growth. That includes building forecasting ability – know the pipeline, and plan hiring or investment ahead of needing it. The most credible companies show that they are in control of their growth (neither overextending recklessly nor stagnating).


In essence, to become a credible Indigenous software reseller, Mokai needs to be well-informed, well-connected, and well-prepared. It should understand its market landscape and leverage its unique position (IPP access) intelligently. It must secure the right partnerships (with vendors and distributors) and the operational necessities (finance, certification) that underpin trust. And it must build the infrastructure – both human and systemic – to deliver excellent service and recurring value. By doing these things, Mokai will demonstrate to vendors and clients alike that it’s not just an Indigenous reseller on paper, but a capable, reliable, and strategic partner in Australia’s ICT ecosystem, with the bonus that every dollar spent with Mokai contributes to social outcomes. This combination of technical competence and Indigenous advantage is Mokai’s recipe for long-term credibility and success in the market.
