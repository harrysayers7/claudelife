You're right to push me - I was too focused on tactical execution. Let me think more strategically about **fundamental business model and strategic viability questions**:

## **1. MARKET OPPORTUNITY & VALIDATION GAPS**

### Market Size & Attractiveness
- **What's the actual TAM/SAM/SOM?** Total government cybersecurity spend? Indigenous-accessible portion? Mokai's realistic market share?
- **Growth trajectory**: Is government cyber spending growing, flat, declining? At what rate?
- **Market concentration**: Are 5 big firms taking 80% of contracts? Or fragmented?
- **Procurement velocity**: How many RFQs/RFPs are issued monthly that Mokai could bid on?
- **Win rate expectations**: What's realistic for a new Indigenous cybersecurity firm? 10%? 30%?

### Business Model Validation
- **Has this model worked elsewhere?** Are there successful precedents of Indigenous prime contractors in cybersecurity? In other technical fields?
- **Proof points**: What evidence exists that government buyers will pay a premium (or even parity) for Indigenous + quality cybersecurity?
- **Customer willingness to pay**: Will agencies choose Mokai over established firms like Deloitte, PwC, or specialist boutiques?

---

## **2. COMPETITIVE STRATEGY GAPS**

### Competitive Intelligence (MAJOR GAP)
- **Who are the actual competitors?**
  - Other Indigenous cybersecurity firms (how many, who, what do they offer?)
  - Non-Indigenous boutique cybersecurity firms
  - Big 4 consulting (Deloitte, PwC, EY, KPMG cyber practices)
  - Freelance IRAP assessors and contractors

- **What are they charging?** Day rates, project rates, margins?
- **How do they position themselves?** Technical depth? Price? Speed? Relationships?
- **What's their track record?** How many government contracts have they won?

### Sustainable Competitive Advantage (CRITICAL UNKNOWN)
- **Beyond IPP, what's defensible?** IPP preference can get you in the door, but what keeps clients coming back?
- **Can competitors replicate Mokai's model?** What stops a Big 4 from partnering with an Indigenous business?
- **Is Jack's network a moat?** Or can competitors hire the same contractors?
- **What gets stronger with scale?** Network effects? Reputation? Expertise? Or does it get harder to maintain quality?

### Competitive Response
- **What happens when you win?** Do competitors undercut on price? Badmouth quality? Partner with other Indigenous businesses?
- **Market disruption scenarios**: What if a well-funded competitor enters the Indigenous cybersecurity space?

---

## **3. BUSINESS MODEL ECONOMICS & VIABILITY**

### Unit Economics at Scale
- **What does a typical project look like economically?**
  - Average contract size? Duration? Margin?
  - Cost to acquire customer (CAC)?
  - Customer lifetime value (CLV)?
  - CAC:CLV ratio sustainable?

### Profitability Path (MAJOR UNKNOWN)
- **At what revenue level is Mokai profitable?**
  - Covering fixed costs (insurance, compliance, overhead)?
  - Providing livable salaries for Harry/Jack/Kelly?
  - Building reserves for growth?

- **What's the path to $500K? $1M? $2M revenue?**
  - How many contracts needed?
  - How many contractors?
  - How much of Harry/Jack/Kelly's time?

### Margin Reality Check
- **Are 20-40% service margins achievable?**
  - What if contractors demand 80% of billing rate?
  - What if payroll tax + overhead is higher than expected?
  - What if competition drives margins down to 15%?

- **Are 10-15% product margins worth it?**
  - Does the working capital burden justify the return?
  - Can you compete with other panel vendors?

---

## **4. STRATEGIC DEPENDENCIES & RISKS**

### Founder Dependencies (CRITICAL)
- **What happens if Jack leaves?** The entire contractor network and technical credibility disappears?
- **What if Jack's network isn't as robust as assumed?** Can't find contractors for key specialties? Contractors unreliable?
- **Harry's IPP expertise**: What if procurement rules change? What if personal relationships don't translate to contracts?
- **Kelly's marketing impact**: Can she actually generate qualified leads? Or is Mokai dependent on Jack's network for referrals?

### Single Points of Failure
- **Government panel dependency**: What if panels don't reopen? Or reopen with stricter requirements?
- **IPP policy risk**: What if IPP is weakened or eliminated by a policy change?
- **Supply Nation certification**: What if recertification fails for some reason?
- **Contractor availability**: What if Jack's network is committed to other projects when you need them?

### Market Dependencies
- **Government budget cuts**: What if cybersecurity spending is reduced?
- **Vendor relationship failures**: What if key distributors don't approve credit or partnership terms?
- **Client concentration**: What if 80% of revenue comes from 1-2 clients? Then one leaves?

---

## **5. GROWTH STRATEGY UNKNOWNS**

### Scaling Path (MAJOR GAP)
- **How do you scale systematically?**
  - Can you train/certify new contractors to Mokai standards?
  - Or are you forever dependent on Jack's pre-existing network?
  - At what point do you hire permanent technical staff?

### Service Mix Sequencing
- **Which service to lead with?**
  - Essential Eight uplifts (easier to win, lower margin)?
  - IRAP assessments (harder to win, higher margin)?
  - Penetration testing (competitive, commoditized)?

- **Should products come before or after services?**
  - Products might be faster revenue but lower margin
  - Services build reputation but need case studies first

### Geographic Expansion
- **ACT/NSW first, then national?** Or national from day one?
- **Federal vs. State government focus?** Different procurement processes, different relationships needed
- **When to expand beyond government?** Enterprise clients as diversification or distraction?

### Partnership vs. Direct Strategy
- **Should Mokai subcontract to larger firms first?**
  - Build track record and cash flow as subcontractor?
  - Then go direct once proven?

- **Or go direct from day one?**
  - Harder to win but keeps margins and control?
  - Builds brand faster?

## **6. FOUNDER ALIGNMENT & GOVERNANCE GAPS**

### Vision & Time Horizon (POTENTIALLY CRITICAL)
- **What does success look like for each founder?**
  - Harry: Build and sell? Build and hold? Build for passive income?
  - Jack: Technical credibility boost then exit? Long-term commitment?
  - Kelly: Full-time role or side engagement?

- **What's the time commitment expectation?**
  - Full-time vs. part-time for each founder?
  - What if someone has competing priorities?

### Decision-Making Authority (FROM SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT GAPS)
- **Who decides what?**
  - Service pricing: Harry or Jack?
  - Contractor selection: Jack unilaterally or board approval?
  - Client acceptance: Who has final say?
  - Product vendor selection: Jack or Harry?

### Conflict Resolution
- **What happens in a 2-1 deadlock?** (50-50 + COO structure is unclear)
- **What if Harry and Jack disagree on strategy?**
- **What if Kelly's marketing approach conflicts with Jack's technical credibility concerns?**

---

## **7. CAPITAL STRATEGY & FUNDING GAPS**

### Capital Requirements (UNDER-SPECIFIED)
- **How much capital is actually needed to get to cash-flow positive?**
  - Working capital for contractor payments?
  - Working capital for product purchases?
  - Operating expenses pre-revenue?
  - Insurance and compliance costs?

### Funding Strategy
- **Bootstrap or raise capital?**
  - If bootstrap: Do founders have personal capital to inject?
  - If raise: From whom without violating Indigenous ownership threshold?

- **Debt vs. Equity?**
  - Invoice financing for contractor payments?
  - Business line of credit for product purchases?
  - Equity from Indigenous investment funds?

### Indigenous Ownership Preservation
- **How to raise capital without dropping below 51%?**
- **What if you need $500K to scale? Where does it come from?**
- **Debt capacity given no revenue history?**

---

## **8. VALUE CREATION & EXIT STRATEGY GAPS**

### What Makes Mokai Valuable? (FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION)
- **Is this a lifestyle business or a scalable enterprise?**
- **What's the exit strategy?**
  - Build to sell to a larger cybersecurity firm?
  - Build to sell to an Indigenous investment group?
  - Build for long-term cash flow and dividend distribution?
  - Build to pass on to next generation?

### Enterprise Value Drivers
- **What increases Mokai's value over time?**
  - Recurring revenue contracts?
  - Proprietary methodologies or IP?
  - Large vetted contractor network?
  - Government panel position and track record?
  - Brand reputation?

### Founder Dependency Risk
- **How to build value beyond founders?**
  - Can the business operate without Jack? Without Harry?
  - Are client relationships transferable?
  - Are processes documented and systematic?

---

## **9. STRATEGIC OPTIONS & DECISION TREES**

### Alternative Paths to Success (NOT EXPLORED)
- **Option A**: Start as subcontractor to Big 4, build track record, then go direct
- **Option B**: Lead with products (easier to win), use to cross-sell services
- **Option C**: Partner with existing Indigenous businesses, white-label services
- **Option D**: Focus exclusively on services, forget products entirely
- **Option E**: Focus exclusively on Essential Eight (one service, done really well)

### Decision Framework Needed
- **How to decide which contracts to pursue?** Qualification criteria?
- **How to decide which contractors to engage?** Vetting process?
- **How to decide which services to prioritize?** Market demand vs. capability vs. margin?

---

## **10. CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS (NOT EXPLICITLY DEFINED)**

### What Has to Go Right?
1. Jack's network is as strong as believed and contractors available/reliable
2. Government panels reopen within 6-12 months
3. IPP preference translates to actual contract wins
4. First 2-3 contracts are delivered successfully and generate testimonials
5. Working capital can be secured for contractor/product payments
6. No major policy changes to IPP/Indigenous procurement
7. Founders remain aligned and committed

### What Could Kill Mokai?
1. Can't win contracts despite IPP (quality concerns, price, or procurement changes)
2. Contractor quality/reliability issues damage reputation early
3. Cash flow crisis from payment timing mismatches
4. Jack leaves or network doesn't deliver
5. Founder conflict/misalignment
6. Competitors (Indigenous or non-Indigenous) move faster/better
7. Supply Nation certification issues

## **STRATEGIC RESEARCH PRIORITIES (Re-Ranked)**

1. **Competitive intelligence** - Who are you *actually* competing against and how do you win?
2. **Business model validation** - Has anyone succeeded with this model? What's the proof?
3. **Founder alignment** - Vision, time horizon, decision-making, conflict resolution
4. **Market opportunity sizing** - Is this a $500K business or $5M business potential?
5. **Critical success factor validation** - Test assumptions about Jack's network, contractor availability, IPP preference conversion
6. **Capital requirements** - Real numbers for cash needed to get to cash-flow positive
7. **Unit economics modeling** - What does a typical project look like financially?
8. **Strategic options analysis** - What are alternative paths and which is optimal?

Is **that** everything from a business strategist perspective?
