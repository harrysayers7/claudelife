Operating Model & Business Architecture for a Lean Cyber Consulting Firm (Mokai)

Executive Summary


Target Operating Model (TOM): A TOM defines the future-state blueprint of how an organization delivers value. It translates strategy into how the business will run – covering People, Process, Technology, Governance, and Finance. Unlike a Business Model (the “what” of value propositions and revenue), an Operating Model focuses on the “how, where, and when” of service delivery. Key components typically include skilled people and roles, core processes/workflows, enabling technology systems, governance structures, and financial/performance metrics.

Business Architecture Fundamentals: Australian professional service firms (e.g. cyber consultancies) often design their operating models using structured frameworks. Tools like the Operating Model Canvas (based on POLISM: Processes, Organization/People, Locations, Information, Suppliers, Management systems) help map out operations on one page. The Business Model Canvas complements this by capturing market-facing elements (customer segments, value propositions, revenue streams, etc.), which the operating model must support. Process design tools like RACI charts (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) clarify roles in workflows, while SIPOC diagrams (Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers) give a high-level view of service processes for quality and efficiency.

Service Delivery Models (In-house vs Contractors): Lean consultancies often leverage contractor networks or “associate” models instead of maintaining a large in-house staff. This offers scalability and lower fixed costs but requires careful management. In-house delivery (employees) provides more control, consistency and easier enforcement of standards, whereas a contractor-led model offers flexibility but can pose risks around quality control, intellectual property, and continuity. Many boutique Australian firms use a hybrid approach – a small core team ensuring quality and client management, supported by vetted contractors for specialized work.

Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Establishing lean but robust SOPs is critical for consistency and compliance. Best practices include documented processes for contractor onboarding (NDAs, background checks, tool access), quality assurance (peer review, approval checklists for deliverables), financial workflows (time tracking, invoicing, contractor payments, expense approvals), and risk & compliance management (following ISO 27001 policies, aligning with ASD Essential Eight controls). These SOPs ensure even a small firm operates with big-firm discipline despite limited resources.

Lean Operations & Compliance: A lean operation can still meet stringent security compliance (important for a cyber firm). Using cloud-based tools and templates, even SMEs can implement an Information Security Management System in line with ISO 27001, which provides a structured framework for protecting data. Compliance with standards (ISO 27001, Essential Eight) can be built into daily processes – e.g. enforcing access controls, patch management, incident response plans – to both protect the firm and to reassure government clients. Achieving ISO 27001 or demonstrating Essential Eight maturity gives a competitive edge in Australia by signaling trust and meeting procurement requirements.

Case Examples (Australian Cyber SMEs): Successful Australian cyber consultancies have embraced lean, flexible models. For instance, one new indigenous-owned cyber startup launched virtual CISO services with on-demand, fractional engagements instead of full-time staffing. Their model offers tiered advisory packages (e.g. monthly CISO consults vs. ongoing risk governance involvement) to scale with client needs. Another provider (Virtuelle) productized the government’s Essential Eight framework into tiered service packages aligned to maturity levels, offering clients Bronze/Silver/Gold-style options with defined deliverables and hours. These examples show how packaging and flexibility enable small firms to punch above their weight.

Productizing Consulting Services: Turning ad-hoc services (pen testing, IRAP assessments, Essential Eight uplift, etc.) into standardized offerings yields big benefits. Productized services are defined, repeatable packages – for example, a “Penetration Test Lite” (fixed-scope, fixed-price for SMBs) vs. “Penetration Test Premium” (deeper testing + compliance reporting). Benefits include more consistent delivery quality, improved margins through efficiency, and faster sales cycles since scoping is predefined. It also helps shift from billing purely hourly to value-based packages. Many firms introduce tiered consulting packages – e.g. retainer-based offerings where clients choose Silver/Gold/Platinum support levels. Government clients often prefer this, as it provides clarity on deliverables and cost over time, while ensuring access to expertise when needed (e.g. a cybersecurity advisory retainer that guarantees a certain number of hours or reports per month).

Customization vs. Repeatability: The challenge in a small consultancy is balancing bespoke service (to meet unique client needs) with standardization (to scale efficiently). The key is to productize the core – develop standard methodologies, checklists, and templates – while allowing some configurable elements per client. For example, Mokai could have a core IRAP assessment toolkit, but adjust the final recommendations to each client’s environment. A good rule is 70-80% standard approach, 20-30% tailored output. This ensures efficiency and quality control, yet maintains flexibility. Over time, as common patterns emerge, even custom work can feed back into new service “products.”

First Steps for Mokai (Tactical Playbook):

1. Document the Current State: Map out Mokai’s current operating model – list existing processes (sales, delivery, reporting), roles (even if one person wears many hats), and technologies in use. A mini Operating Model Canvas exercise could help identify gaps.


2. Define the Target Vision: Clarify the strategic goals (e.g. become a go-to cyber advisor for government agencies). From this, define what TOM capabilities are needed – e.g. “highly responsive virtual CISO service,” “strong compliance credentials (ISO 27001 certified),” etc.


3. Design Key Processes: Start with critical workflows. Develop SOPs for client engagement delivery (from proposal to deliverable sign-off), contractor management (recruiting, onboarding, evaluating performance), and quality assurance (review steps for every report). Use RACI matrices to assign responsibilities for each step.


4. Establish Governance & Roles: Even if small, assign clear roles – e.g. Managing Director (Accountable for final quality & financial decisions), Project Lead (Responsible for delivery), etc. Create a simple governance cadence (weekly ops meeting, monthly financial review, quarterly strategy check).


5. Invest in Enabling Tech: Implement affordable tools to automate and support operations: project management software, a secure document repository, time-tracking/invoicing tools, and collaboration platforms. Ensure they meet security best practices (MFA, encryption) in line with Essential Eight.


6. Embed Security & Compliance: Develop an internal mini-ISMS. Write basic policies (acceptable use, data handling, incident response) and train all staff/contractors on them. Align these policies with Essential Eight mitigation strategies (application control, patching, backups, etc.) so that internal operations are secure – a selling point for clients.


7. Productize Offerings: Select Mokai’s core services and package them. For example, create a “Essential 8 Gap Assessment” product with a defined timeline and deliverable, or a “SME Cybersecurity Starter Package”. Prepare standard templates for proposals and reports for these offerings to streamline delivery.


8. Pilot and Refine: Implement the new operating model elements on a small scale (perhaps with an internal project or a friendly client as a pilot). Gather feedback, identify snags, and iterate. For instance, after onboarding a few contractors, review how well the process worked and adjust the SOP as needed.



Risks in a Contractor-Led Model: Running lean with contractors has inherent risks, but they can be mitigated (see detailed list below). The most common risks include quality inconsistency, IP ownership issues, compliance and liability gaps, and reliance on individuals. Mitigations involve robust contracts, oversight processes, and building a resilient partner network. With proactive management, Mokai can leverage the flexibility of contractors while controlling the risks.


1. TOM & Business Architecture Fundamentals

Defining the Target Operating Model: A Target Operating Model (TOM) is a strategic blueprint for how the business will operate in its desired future state. It translates high-level strategy into the nuts-and-bolts of running the organization. In simple terms, if the business model defines what a company offers and to whom, the operating model defines how the company delivers that value, day-to-day and end-to-end. Key elements of a TOM typically cover:

People & Organization: The skills, roles, organizational structure, and culture needed. This includes talent acquisition and management strategies (critical for a consultancy where people are the product).

Processes: The core workflows and processes that deliver value. For a cyber firm, this might include how a penetration test is executed, how client reports are produced, or how an incident response is handled. All operational areas (sales, delivery, support, risk management, etc.) should be mapped out.

Technology: The tools and systems enabling the above processes. This spans everything from collaboration software and cybersecurity tools to knowledge repositories. Technology should support efficient work and scalability (e.g. using cloud-based platforms to allow contractors remote access securely).

Governance: The decision-making structures, policies, and oversight mechanisms. This ensures the operations stay aligned to strategy and comply with requirements. In a TOM, governance includes defining who makes which decisions, how performance is measured, and how continuous improvement is driven.

Finance & Metrics: (Performance Insights) The financial model and performance metrics that underpin the operations. A lean consulting firm must monitor project profitability, cash flow, and utilization. Including Finance in the operating model ensures that cost structure, pricing strategy, and investment in capabilities are all aligned with sustainable growth.


These components are interrelated. For example, if Mokai’s strategy is to be a “scalable on-demand cyber advisor,” the TOM might emphasize a flexible People model (contractor network), processes for rapid deployment to clients, technology like virtual meeting platforms and secure portals, governance for quality control of deliverables, and financial practices to handle variable project flow.

Australian Professional Services Operating Models: Many Australian tech and cyber consultancies use similar TOM fundamentals, but tailored to their scale. Larger firms (e.g. the “Big 4” consulting firms or national cyber providers) often formalize their operating models into multiple “layers”. For instance, KPMG’s Target Operating Model methodology uses six layers: Process, People, Service Delivery Model, Technology, Performance Insights, and Governance. This extended view ensures the TOM addresses where and how work is done (service delivery model could include onshore vs offshore or contractor use), how success is measured (performance/finance metrics), and how it’s controlled (governance).

Mid-sized Australian firms might be less explicit but still cover these basics. For example, an Aussie cybersecurity consultancy might articulate its operating model as:

People: A mix of in-house consultants and associates with IRAP assessor certifications.

Process: Standard methodologies aligned to ASD’s guidelines (e.g. performing Essential Eight maturity assessments or pen-tests with documented steps).

Technology: Use of secure cloud environments to share assessment results with clients, and automation tools for reporting.

Governance: Adherence to ISO 9001 (quality management) and ISO 27001 (security management) for internal processes, with regular audits or management reviews.

Finance: Perhaps a lean cost base with mostly variable contractor costs, pricing models like fixed-fee packages for common services, and KPIs like project gross margin and contractor utilization rate.


By defining these elements, even informally, a firm creates a common understanding of “how we operate to succeed.” A clear TOM is valuable for aligning any future changes or growth (for instance, if Mokai wants to pursue more government contracts, the TOM may need stronger governance and compliance processes to meet government supplier expectations).

Frameworks for Operating Model & Business Design: A number of frameworks can guide the creation of a TOM and the overall business architecture:

Operating Model Canvas (POLISM): This is a one-page representation of the operating model, structured around six dimensions: Processes, Organization (People), Locations, Information, Suppliers, and Management Systems. Using an Operating Model Canvas helps Mokai visually map how work gets done and resources flow. For example, Processes might include “Deliver Cyber Assessment” or “Manage Client Relationship”; Organization lists key roles (e.g. Principal Consultant, Contractor Pool, Project Coordinator); Locations could note remote work plus any on-site at client needs; Information captures IT systems and data flows (e.g. using a secure project management SaaS); Suppliers/Partners might include cloud providers or subcontractors (for services like malware forensics); Management Systems includes how Mokai will plan, budget, and ensure quality (e.g. quarterly planning meetings, performance dashboards, continuous improvement process). The Operating Model Canvas ensures all crucial elements are considered in unison. (See Table 1 below for an example of how Mokai might fill out such a canvas.)

Business Model Canvas: Originally developed by Strategyzer, this 9-block canvas captures the business model – Customer Segments, Value Propositions, Channels, Customer Relationships, Revenue Streams, Key Activities, Key Resources, Key Partners, and Cost Structure. It’s strategic rather than operational. For an indigenous-owned cyber consultancy, a Business Model Canvas helps clarify things like: target customer segments (e.g. federal agencies, state government departments, maybe critical infrastructure SMEs), the value proposition (e.g. “cybersecurity expertise with cultural awareness and government compliance know-how”), key partners (perhaps partnerships with larger primes or tools vendors), and so on. The Business Model Canvas and Operating Model Canvas are complementary – the business model informs what the operating model must deliver. For instance, if a key activity in the business model is “provide Essential 8 maturity uplift services,” the operating model must have processes and people to do that efficiently. Business Model Canvas is useful early on to ensure the operating design is anchored to how the firm will make money and differentiate itself.

RACI Charts: A RACI matrix is a simple yet powerful tool to define who does what in a process. RACI stands for Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed. In the context of a cyber consulting project, Mokai can create a RACI chart for each major process or project stage. For example, consider a penetration testing engagement:

Task: Conduct vulnerability scanning – Responsible (R): Contractor Pentester; Accountable (A): Lead Consultant (ensures it’s done correctly); Consulted (C): Client’s IT admin (to clarify any network segments); Informed (I): Project Manager (keeps timeline).

Task: Review and finalize the Pen Test report – R: Lead Consultant; A: Managing Director (final sign-off); C: Another senior consultant for peer review; I: Client stakeholder (kept in loop that report is being finalized).


By assigning RACI for key steps (sales proposals, onboarding a new contractor, delivering the project, invoicing, etc.), Mokai prevents confusion and ensures accountability. RACI charts improve efficiency by making sure everyone understands their role in each process. They are especially useful in a lean team where individuals juggle multiple roles – RACI will clarify when the same person is wearing which hat.

SIPOC Diagram: SIPOC stands for Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers. It’s a high-level process mapping tool, often used in Six Sigma and service management. For a consultancy, SIPOC can be used to outline an entire service delivery chain in simple terms. For instance, for “Contractor Onboarding” process, a SIPOC might look like:

Suppliers: New contractor candidates; Background check service; IT team (for account setup).

Inputs: Candidate’s resume/credentials; Signed NDA; Equipment or access requests.

Process: (Key steps) – Screen candidate -> sign contract -> set up accounts/tool access -> orientation on methodology -> pair with mentor on first project.

Outputs: Ready-to-go contractor with access and knowledge; documentation of onboarding (contracts, training completed).

Customers: Internal project teams (who will use the contractor’s services); ultimately the firm’s clients (who expect the contractor is properly enabled).


SIPOC gives a concise overview of a process, helping identify any missing elements or inefficiencies. For a cyber firm, SIPOCs could be drawn for processes like “Deliver an IRAP Assessment” or “Respond to Incident” to ensure all upstream inputs and downstream outputs are considered.


Using these frameworks provides structure and aids communication. When dealing with sophisticated clients or partners (especially government), being able to show that Mokai has thought through its operating model – perhaps by sharing an operating model canvas snapshot or a RACI chart for project governance – can increase credibility. Moreover, frameworks ensure that as Mokai grows, it has a reference model to keep the business aligned (preventing ad-hoc operations from leading to chaos).

Table 1. Operating Model Canvas Excerpt – Mokai Cyber Consulting (Hypothetical)

Canvas Element	Mokai – Key Considerations (Example)

Value Proposition (not a Canvas element per se, but context)	Trusted Indigenous-led cybersecurity advisory for government and SMBs – offering flexible, on-demand expertise with cultural understanding. (This informs all elements below.)
Processes	Core service delivery processes: 1) Security Assessment (Essential 8 gap analysis, IRAP prep), 2) Penetration Testing, 3) vCISO Advisory. Support processes: Sales & proposal, Contractor onboarding, Quality assurance review, Invoicing & reporting. Each process has SOPs and KPIs (e.g. delivery turnaround time, report quality checklist).
Organization (People)	Small core team (Founder/MD, Delivery Lead, Client Manager) plus network of 5-10 contract consultants (IRAP assessors, penetration testers, GRC specialists). Define roles clearly – e.g. Delivery Lead allocates work to contractors and is accountable for outcomes. Use RACI for project roles. Emphasis on continuous training and a culture of knowledge sharing (perhaps via a weekly team call for contractors).
Locations	Work is primarily remote. Office address in Sydney for business registration; contractors distributed across Australia (ensuring coverage of various states for client onsite needs). If needed, use co-working space for team meetings. Client work done on-site only when required (e.g. some government systems assessments). Leverage cloud collaboration so location is not a barrier.
Information (Technology)	Cloud-first IT stack: Secure project management platform (with client portal feature), cloud document storage with encryption (for client reports), messaging (Teams/Slack) for coordination. Use of specialized cyber tools: e.g. vulnerability scanning tools, security testing labs – all accessible via cloud. Strong access controls (MFA, least privilege) enforced on all systems (aligning with Essential Eight). Also, maintain an internal knowledge base (Confluence or similar) with SOPs, templates, and past project lessons.
Suppliers/Partners	Key partners: “Associate” contractors who supply expert labor; possibly an arrangement with a larger firm for subcontracting overflow work or accessing niche expertise (e.g. digital forensics). Vendor partners: cloud providers (for hosting any client data), security software vendors (providing tools under license). Maintain MOUs or contracts with partners, ensuring clarity on confidentiality and quality expectations.
Management Systems	Governance and management processes: weekly operations review (to track projects, issues), monthly financial review (billings, pipeline), quarterly strategy meetings. Use simple dashboards for KPIs: project margins, client satisfaction, contractor utilization. Quality management: Every deliverable goes through a peer review by a senior associate (per SOP). Risk management: maintain a risk register (covering project risks and enterprise risks, including security of our own data) reviewed monthly. Compliance: conduct an internal audit against ISO 27001 controls annually. Continuous improvement: after each project, do a “lessons learned” brief to refine SOPs.

2. Service Business Operating Models

Designing an operating model for a service-based business – like a consulting firm – brings unique considerations. Unlike product companies, consulting is highly people-driven and often project-based. Here we examine how Mokai (and similar consultancies) can structure a lean, effective service delivery model, with emphasis on using contractors versus in-house staff, implementing SOPs, ensuring compliance, and learning from case examples.

2.1 Contractor Networks vs In-House Staff

The Contractor-Based Model: Many lean consultancies opt to engage a network of independent contractors or associates to deliver services, rather than hiring a large full-time staff. This model has clear advantages for a small firm:

Flexibility & Scalability: Contractors can be brought in as needed per project, allowing the firm to scale up for a large contract and scale down during lulls. Mokai can tap specialized skills on-demand (e.g. an OT security expert for a specific client) without carrying that person on payroll.

Lower Fixed Costs: With contractors, there are minimal fixed salaries or benefits. The cost is typically a variable share of project revenue. This keeps the firm’s overhead lean, an important factor for survival in early stages.

Access to Talent: A small firm might not attract a full-time senior expert due to limited budget or hours, but can still utilize top talent as a contractor on a part-time basis, especially retirees or freelancers in cybersecurity who prefer flexible engagements.


However, a contractor-heavy model also introduces challenges and risks:

Quality Control: Contractors are autonomous. They might each have different working styles or standards. Without direct managerial oversight (as with employees), ensuring consistent deliverable quality requires robust processes (more on that in SOPs). As one industry observer noted, heavy reliance on 1099 contractors (freelancers) can lead to *“reduced internal oversight and quality control, potentially increasing the risk of inconsistent deliverables or variable standards.”*. Mokai must mitigate this by setting clear work standards and doing thorough reviews.

Accountability and Continuity: Contractors might not be as invested in the firm’s long-term success or the client relationship. They may juggle multiple clients. This can affect availability and continuity. For example, if a contractor is busy or ends their association, Mokai could be left scrambling mid-project. Long-term client development (fostering deep understanding of the client’s business) is harder if the team keeps rotating. (One solution: keep a core group of repeat contractors and treat them as team members.)

IP and Confidentiality: With independent parties comes the need for tight contractual controls. All work product (reports, tools, methodologies) must be legally assigned to Mokai or the client as appropriate. According to one consulting firm’s warning, in contractor setups *“IP rights may remain ambiguous or contested unless robust agreements specify that all IP created belongs to the company or client”*. Similarly, NDAs and conflict-of-interest clauses are essential, since contractors might work with other firms – some of whom could even be competitors or clients in similar sectors.

Trust and Client Perception: Clients – especially government – may expect a stable team. If they perceive the consultancy is just a “body shop” pulling in random freelancers, it could affect confidence. Mokai should be transparent yet reassuring: emphasize that associates are vetted experts, possibly even introduce key contractors as part of “our team” in proposals, highlighting credentials. Australian government clients may inquire about team stability and vet individuals, so Mokai should be prepared to show that contractors are reliable and have necessary clearances/certifications.

Legal/Compliance: In Australia, there are also considerations of not breaching labor laws (e.g. avoiding sham contracting). Ensuring each contractor is legitimately running a business (with own insurance, etc.) can protect against any claims of employee entitlements. There’s also compliance like ensuring contractors follow the firm’s policies (security, safety, etc.) as diligently as employees would.


The In-House Model (Employees): Alternatively, hiring in-house staff fosters a team with loyalty and easier management control. Benefits include:

Consistency: Employees can be trained in one methodology and expected to follow it. Over time, they deepen their understanding of Mokai’s approach and values. Quality is more within the firm’s direct control through supervision and training.

Availability: An employee typically works only for the firm, so their time (barring multiple projects) is dedicated. This reduces scheduling conflicts. For time-sensitive client needs, an employee might be more readily available.

IP Security: With proper employment contracts, anything created by staff is clearly property of the firm, and they owe duties of confidentiality to only one employer. The firm’s professional indemnity insurance also usually covers employees more automatically.

Team Cohesion: A group of employees can build a strong culture of collaboration, knowledge sharing and mutual accountability. This can improve morale and innovation (contractors might be less inclined to go the extra mile in improving internal processes, for instance).


However, for a small consultancy, an all-employee model has downsides:

Higher Fixed Costs: Salaries, benefits, downtime between projects – these add financial risk. As Devon O’Rourke (who scaled a consulting firm from solo to a team) noted, moving from contractors (where you might take ~30% margin on their work) to full employees means taking on steady pay obligations even when future revenue is uncertain. This can strain cash flow if not carefully timed with growth.

Utilization Pressure: With employees, one must keep them sufficiently billable. A small firm might struggle to ensure everyone has enough project work all the time, whereas contractors you simply don’t engage when not needed. O’Rourke explained that planning beyond 3-6 months can be hard in consulting, yet payroll is a fixed certainty, so one needs confidence in sales pipeline to expand staff.

Limited Skill Range: A few employees might not cover all specialization needs. You might still need contractors for niches, which can complicate the model (a mixed model of core employees + contractors is common).


Hybrid Approach: In practice, many boutique consultancies combine both. A sensible approach for Mokai may be:

Keep a core team of perhaps a few key employees or long-term contractors in strategic roles: e.g. a Lead Cybersecurity Consultant (could double as Quality Manager), a Business Development manager, etc. These folks maintain institutional knowledge, client relationships, and oversee quality.

Maintain a roster of vetted contractors for delivery: e.g. a pool of penetration testers, compliance assessors, etc., who are engaged per project. Over time, Mokai could aim to convert the most indispensable contractors into employees (as the business stabilizes) – similar to how some firms initially contract experts then later hire them full-time once the workload and finances justify it.

Use contract-to-hire as a strategy: Bring in people as contractors to test fit and demand, then offer full employment to those who prove to be a great match and for whom there’s consistent work. This reduces risk and has been done by others (the earlier example from Fluvio consulting: they started two people as contractors to validate the need, then hired one as employee #1 once it made sense).


Importantly, whichever mix Mokai chooses, clarity and fairness in the model are key. If contractors are used, Mokai should:

Ensure solid contract agreements are in place (covering IP assignment, confidentiality, expectations for quality and conduct, non-solicitation of clients, etc.).

Treat contractors as part of the team in terms of communication – include them in team meetings, share knowledge resources, perhaps even include them in performance feedback cycles. The more engaged they feel, the better they represent Mokai.

Keep an eye on contractor performance – have a mechanism to evaluate and, if needed, debrief or stop using contractors who don’t meet standards.


Conversely, if moving towards more employees, Mokai should plan for:

Recruitment and onboarding costs/time,

Putting in place HR basics (payroll, benefits, etc.),

Possibly adjusting pricing to ensure employee costs + overheads are covered while maintaining profitability.


In summary, using contractors is a viable lean strategy and common in consulting, but it needs to be underpinned by rigorous processes and relationship management to succeed. Many Australian consultancies in cybersecurity started this way – leveraging a few respected experts (sometimes the founders’ own network) to deliver projects without huge fixed costs. As long as the client’s outcomes are met and quality is high, this model can be indistinguishable from an all-employee firm from the client’s perspective.

2.2 SOPs for Lean Service Delivery

Having Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) is essential to make a network-based model work. SOPs codify how tasks should be done, ensuring that even if different people execute them, the outcome is consistent. For a cybersecurity consulting firm like Mokai, key SOPs to develop include:

Contractor Onboarding SOP: A step-by-step guide for bringing a new contractor into the fold. This would typically cover:

1. Pre-onboarding: Verification of credentials (e.g. ensure they have necessary certifications or security clearances if required for government work). Also, reference checks or sample work review.


2. Agreements: Having the contractor sign an independent contractor agreement, which includes NDA, IP assignment clauses (so any work they do for Mokai or Mokai’s clients is owned appropriately), non-compete or non-conflict clauses (to protect client info). Also, ensure they provide proof of their own insurance if required (some firms require contractors carry professional indemnity insurance, or Mokai might cover them under its policy – which should be clarified).


3. Account Setup: Creating accounts for the contractor on necessary systems – email, project management, document portal – abiding by the principle of least privilege (only give access to what they need). For security, maintain an access register so when the contract ends, access can be immediately revoked.


4. Orientation: Providing them with Mokai’s key policies and procedures. For example, share a “Contractor Handbook” that highlights the code of conduct, quality expectations, tool usage guidelines, and security policies (if Mokai has an ISMS, contractors must comply with it too). Possibly have them attend a short training on Mokai’s methodology (e.g. how to format reports, how to communicate with clients under Mokai’s brand).


5. Assign Mentor/Point of contact: Initially, pair the new contractor with an internal person or experienced associate who can answer questions and review their first deliverables closely.


6. Initial Project Briefing: When a contractor is first assigned to a project, do a kickoff call involving them, the project manager, and client context overview to set expectations.



Having a formal onboarding SOP reduces time-to-productivity and helps avoid mistakes (like forgetting to have an NDA signed before sharing client data, or failing to set up an account which later causes delays).

Quality Assurance SOP: This is crucial. It should detail how the firm ensures every client deliverable meets a high standard, regardless of who produced it. Elements might include:

Peer Review Process: E.g., “All client reports must be reviewed by a senior consultant not involved in the execution before being sent to client.” This reviewer checks technical accuracy, clarity, grammar, alignment to client’s requirements, etc. They may use a checklist (does the report include an executive summary? are all findings risk-rated? etc.). For example, a small MSP that scaled up noted that implementing a peer-review step helped maintain quality as more contractors did the work, catching issues early.

Use of Templates: Maintain standardized report templates for each service (penetration test report template, risk assessment report template, etc.). The SOP enforces their use so format is consistent. It might also dictate tool usage (e.g. all vulnerability findings must be recorded in our central tracker).

Client Communication Protocols: E.g., major deliverables or communications should be checked by an internal lead. Perhaps the SOP states that any official recommendation to a client is double-checked internally, to avoid an individual contractor accidentally giving advice that conflicts with best practices or contractual scope.

Feedback Loop: After project delivery, gather client feedback and do an internal debrief. If any quality issues arose (e.g., client found a section of report unclear), feed that back into refining templates or training.


By making QA a formal procedure, Mokai signals that quality is system-driven, not person-dependent. It’s easier to assure clients (especially government) that “multiple eyes” review outputs, reducing risk of errors.

Financial Workflow SOP: Even a lean firm needs tight financial controls. This SOP covers:

Project Budgeting & Pricing: Guidelines for pricing services (maybe a rate card for different service types, or rules of thumb for how to estimate effort). Ensuring any proposal has management approval if pricing deviates or is below a certain margin.

Time Tracking and Contractor Invoicing: Define how contractors report their time or deliverables for payment. For example, require monthly timesheets from contractors, approved by the project lead, before invoicing the client. This ensures you only pay for approved work and can bill it onward. If contractors are paid a fixed fee per project, the SOP might cover milestone sign-offs.

Client Invoicing: Steps to generate and send invoices to clients – when (e.g. upon delivery, or monthly for T&M projects), what info must be included (purchase order references for gov clients, etc.), who approves the invoice before sending. Also, tracking receivables (following up if a payment is late).

Expense Management: If contractors or staff incur expenses (travel to client site, special software licenses), have a process for pre-approval and reimbursement. This is important in consulting where travel can be a factor.

Financial Monitoring: Monthly check of project P&L – the SOP might assign the Managing Director to review: revenue vs. contractor costs per project, ensuring target margins are met. If not, an action (like a retrospective analysis to prevent recurrence).


A lean firm must ensure cash flow is healthy; clear SOPs help avoid forgotten billings or uncontrolled costs. Many small businesses fail not from lack of business but from poor financial processes, so this is key.

Risk & Compliance Management SOP: For a cybersecurity firm, this covers both internal and client-related risks.

Internal Security: Outline routine tasks to remain secure. For example: patch management (who ensures all company laptops/servers are updated – perhaps each user but verified monthly), access reviews (every quarter, review user accounts and remove any no-longer-needed access), incident response (what to do if Mokai itself faces a security incident), and business continuity (data backups, etc.). If pursuing ISO 27001, the SOP would align with control requirements (like maintaining asset inventories, performing risk assessments).

Regulatory Compliance: If Mokai handles any sensitive government info, ensure adherence to relevant laws (Australia’s PSPF or ISM rules). This might include everyone needing baseline security clearance or citizenship for certain projects – a note to check and comply per contract.

Client Data & Privacy: An SOP stating how to handle client-provided data (e.g. assessment results, network info). Likely: store it encrypted, only keep it for X time post-project unless otherwise agreed, and properly destroy it thereafter. Compliance with the Australian Privacy Act if handling personal info.

Quality/Process Compliance: If Mokai decides to certify in ISO 9001 or ISO 27001, there will be formal internal audits and documentation. The SOP should schedule those (e.g. an annual internal audit of the ISMS, management review meetings every 6 months).

Continuous Improvement: Part of risk management is improvement. This could be an SOP step to review any incidents or near-misses. E.g., “if a project ran into a major issue (like a missed deadline or client dissatisfaction), convene a root cause analysis meeting, log it in a register, and assign actions to improve.”


Being compliant doesn’t have to mean heavy bureaucracy. Mokai can leverage existing frameworks. For instance, the ASD Essential Eight can serve as a baseline for its own IT operations (use E8 as a checklist to secure Mokai’s systems – the same ones you advise clients on). Many small MSPs in Australia actually package their adherence to standards as a selling point, saying effectively: “we practice what we preach – our own operations are certified/secured to the highest standards.” This gives clients confidence.


Implementing these SOPs might sound like a lot for a small firm, but start simple:

Write them as short documents or checklists.

Use templates available from industry (there are many open SOP templates or guides for consulting firms).

Ensure everyone in the firm is aware and trained on them (including contractors – perhaps incorporate SOP training into onboarding).


One approach is to maintain an Operations Manual (maybe online on Confluence/SharePoint) that houses all SOPs, templates, and policies. Keep it updated and refer to it often so it stays alive.

2.3 Lean Operations Backbone (Tech and Compliance)

To keep operations lean yet effective, Mokai should leverage technology and smart practices:

Automation & Tools: Adopt tools that reduce manual effort. For example, use a proposal automation software or at least templates to cut down time preparing proposals. Use project management tools that send automatic reminders for tasks or timesheets. If budget allows, a lightweight ERP or professional services automation (PSA) tool could integrate project tracking and billing.

Cloud Infrastructure: Embrace cloud services rather than on-premises infrastructure. This avoids large IT overhead and gives flexibility. Many Australian SMEs choose cloud-based document management, which also aids remote collaboration with contractors. Just ensure the chosen cloud providers themselves meet security (for instance, if handling government data, use cloud services certified for government use or known to comply with IRAP standards – AWS, Azure have IRAP-certified environments).

Templates & Knowledge Reuse: Every deliverable type should have a template. Also, maintain a repository of past deliverables (sanitized for confidentiality) as examples or reusable content. Over time, build a library of checklists (e.g. “Top 20 common security gaps for Essential 8 compliance”) that consultants can quickly draw on – improving consistency and speed.

Outsourcing Non-Core Tasks: Lean ops often means focus internal time on high-value work and outsource the rest. Mokai could outsource bookkeeping, payroll, even some marketing (a part-time virtual assistant or marketing service to manage the website/LinkedIn presence). In the earlier case, Fluvio’s founder mentioned using an external accounting firm and bookkeeper rather than hiring internally. This allows the small team to concentrate on client delivery and business growth.


Supporting ISO 27001 and Essential 8: Complying with these doesn’t have to weigh the operation down:

ISO 27001 for a small firm might be achieved via a simplified ISMS using templates. There are kits geared for SMEs that provide policy templates and guidance. It is indeed effort to implement (documentation, training, audit), but many SMEs find the benefits in risk reduction and market credibility are worth it. One pro tip is to integrate ISO controls into everyday SOPs (as we described above) so it doesn’t feel separate.

The Essential Eight (Australia’s baseline strategies) are actually a helpful guide for Mokai’s own IT setup. For example, one of the Eight is application whitelisting – Mokai could simply use only a standard set of approved software for work. Another is daily backups – Mokai can use cloud services that automatically backup data. By aligning to Essential Eight internally, Mokai will naturally be prepared to demonstrate this alignment to clients (and it provides a relatable story: “we achieved maturity level 2 in Essential Eight for our own business, we can help you do the same”).

Certification & Credentials: Achieving certain credentials can bolster the operating model. For example, being an ASD Certified Consulting Provider for IRAP assessments, if applicable, or getting Supply Nation certification (for being Indigenous-owned, which Mokai likely has) plus relevant government supplier panel memberships. These require some paperwork and ongoing compliance (like reporting), so Mokai should incorporate those into its processes.


Case Examples: Let’s spotlight a couple of Australian firms for real-world context:

Hivint (case in point): A few years ago, Hivint was a boutique cyber consultancy in Australia that operated a largely virtual model. They created an online platform “Security Colony” to share knowledge with clients, effectively productizing their consulting insights. They kept a lean team and leveraged a community approach, eventually becoming successful enough to be acquired by a larger company. The takeaway is how they productized knowledge (more in the next section) and ran operations with a small headcount but high impact.

Shearwater Solutions: An Australian cybersecurity company known especially for penetration testing. As they grew from a small team, they implemented formal methodologies (CREST standards for pen testing) and achieved ISO certification, which helped land government contracts. They often spoke at conferences about the importance of process in scaling an offensive security team. This underscores that skill alone doesn’t scale – process and model do.

**vCISO One (Andrew Egoroff’s firm)** as mentioned, is a current example of an Aussie consultancy offering a lean service (virtual CISO) by being flexible. They don’t sell one-off days of consulting; they position it as subscription tiers of strategic guidance. Operationally, that means they can plan capacity (ongoing relationships instead of unpredictable one-offs), and it turns the consulting service into something almost managed-service-like. Internally, they likely use scheduling tools to ensure each client gets their allotted time and use consistent templates for strategic plans and board reports. This shows how an operating model innovation (fractional CISO as a service) can differentiate a small firm.


In all these examples, one can see that lean doesn’t mean unsophisticated. On the contrary, a smaller firm must be more disciplined, because there’s no slack. Everyone wears multiple hats, so processes prevent things from slipping through cracks. By learning from others and adopting best practices from standards, Mokai can present itself as a well-oiled machine, albeit a compact one.

2.4 Case: Scaling via Contractors – Lessons Learned

It’s worth summarizing a narrative from earlier to highlight practical lessons. Devon O’Rourke’s Fluvio started as a one-person consultancy and grew to ~10 in a few years. Initially, to meet a big client’s needs, he brought in contractors and put them on a project full-time, adding a margin on their rate. This allowed him to deliver a larger scope than he could alone. Over time, seeing sustained demand, he transitioned some contractors to full-time hires.

Key takeaways:

Using contractors can validate business growth before committing to hires (lowering risk).

Clients were fine with it as long as the work was good – he was transparent about cost (told the client roughly that he’d take a 30% margin), which built trust.

When converting to employees, he had to adjust the model to maintain margins: they created multiple service levels (principals leading strategy, consultants executing) and ensured each consultant could handle 2 clients instead of being 1-1 allocated. This increased leverage and kept the business financially healthy even with salaries.

He acknowledges the risk: committing to salaries needs confidence in pipeline, which comes from building strong sales/marketing (which he focused on once he had a team to deliver).


For Mokai, this suggests: Start lean with contractors, deliver excellently, build a name. As you secure more recurring or large engagements, then selectively hire to form a stable core. Use pricing strategies (like retainers or multi-client allocation) to keep utilization high. Always watch profitability per project, and don’t be afraid to tweak how you deliver (e.g. bundling services, using juniors vs seniors in certain ratio) to hit target margins.

3. Productizing Consulting Services

In a traditional consulting model, each project is customized – scope, price, deliverables vary by client. Productizing means shifting to pre-defined service “products” – standard offerings that are repeatable and have clear scope/price. This section explores how Mokai can productize its services, the benefits of doing so, examples of productized consulting, and how to maintain the balance between customization and standardization.

3.1 Methods to Productize Services

Identify Repeatable Services: First, pinpoint which services are common and lend themselves to a template approach. In cybersecurity, likely candidates are:

Penetration Testing: Often a fairly standard process. Mokai could offer, say, 3 tiers of pen tests (Basic, Advanced, Red Team Simulation). Each with defined testing depth, tools, and report contents.

IRAP Assessments: Since IRAP (Information Security Registered Assessors Program) has a defined framework, an IRAP assessment service is inherently standardized in process. Mokai can create a product around “IRAP readiness assessment” for organizations seeking Australian government cloud accreditation, with a fixed methodology (mapping to the ISM controls).

Essential Eight Maturity Uplift: As many organizations aim to improve against the Essential Eight, Mokai could formalize an offering like “Essential 8 Quick Start” – includes an initial workshop, a gap analysis report, and a prioritized roadmap, all delivered within e.g. 4 weeks for a fixed fee. If needed, another product could be “Essential 8 Managed Service” as some companies offer.

Incident Response Retainer: Offer a package where a client pays a monthly or annual fee to have Mokai “on call” for incident response plus maybe quarterly drills or policy reviews. This is a way to productize IR (which is reactive by nature) into a subscription-like service.


Standardize Scope and Deliverables: For each chosen service “product”, define:

The scope (what’s included, what’s not). E.g. Pen Test Basic: up to 2 IP addresses, external only, no social engineering, delivered in 2 weeks.

The deliverables (what the client gets). E.g. for Pen Test Basic: A findings report with executive summary, technical details, and a remediation checklist; plus a one-hour walkthrough meeting. Having this clear prevents scope creep and also helps with pricing consistently.

Methodology: Document the steps that will be taken (which can double as both internal guide and client-facing description to market the service). E.g. “Our Essential 8 Assessment includes: a documentation review, staff interviews, technical configuration checks, then we calculate your maturity for each strategy using ACSC’s model, etc.” When clients see a well-defined method, it builds confidence that you’ve done this before successfully.


Create Supporting Collateral: Develop re-usable proposal text, brochures, or one-pagers for each productized service. This makes sales easier – you’re not writing from scratch each time. It also reinforces consistency (everyone in the firm describes the service the same way). If possible, gather case studies for each service type to further standardize the pitch (e.g. “Client X achieved Level 2 maturity in 3 months using our Essential 8 uplift package”).

Implement Pricing Tiers or Fixed Pricing: Productization often involves more transparent or packaged pricing:

Some services can be fixed price because scope is narrow and controlled (e.g. a cloud configuration security review for up to Y resources might be $X flat).

Others might be tiered. For example, a virtual CISO service might have Silver, Gold, Platinum tiers – as seen in an example from the UK where Virtual Cyber Consultant service had 4 tiers with differing hours and benefits. Similarly, an Australian virtual CISO offering provides flexible engagement models that scale by need (monthly check-ins vs. embedded oversight).

Tiered packages could also apply to compliance services: Basic (policy templates + light review), Standard (full assessment, some implementation help), Enterprise (hands-on support to implement controls and continuous monitoring). This is exactly how some providers in Australia structure Essential 8 managed services – offering tiered packages so that clients can pick what suits their budget and required maturity.

For retainer services, define levels by how many hours or what deliverables per period. E.g., Bronze Cyber Advisory: 5 hours of consulting per month, quarterly security newsletter, and one annual on-site workshop; Silver: 10 hours per month, etc.


Systemize Delivery: Internally, treat each product as a mini-project template. Create a standard work-breakdown for it. If Mokai sells an Essential 8 Quick Start, the team knows it involves 3 days of work following a script. This reduces planning time and allows even relatively less experienced team members (or contractors) to execute by following the playbook.

Use Branding for Products: Give the packages names (as hinted above). This makes marketing easier (“Mokai Essential8 Accelerator™” sounds more like a product). It also helps shift perception from hourly labor to an outcome-based solution.

3.2 Benefits of Service Productization

Why go through the effort of productizing? Several key benefits:

Consistent Quality & Delivery: When services are repeatable, you refine the approach over multiple iterations. Lessons learned from one client get baked into the standard for the next. This leads to more predictable outcomes. For instance, if every risk assessment follows the same framework, Mokai can ensure all important areas are covered for each client, reducing the chance of oversight.

Improved Margin & Efficiency: The first time you deliver a new service, you invest extra time to create templates and process. But subsequently, the efficiency skyrockets – you’re not reinventing the wheel each time. This means the work can often be done faster or by more junior staff/contractors following the “recipe,” improving profit margin. Over time, toolkits may be developed (scripts, checklists, automated scanners) to speed up those standard services even more.

Easier Training & Onboarding: New team members or contractors can get up to speed faster by learning the “Mokai way” for each productized service. There’s documentation and precedent, which is less overwhelming than throwing them into a completely bespoke project.

Sales Velocity and Win Rate: Selling becomes easier when offerings are clear. Clients can more quickly understand what they are buying and see options to choose from. It also helps in proposals – instead of starting blank, you might have a menu of services to mix-and-match. Faster scoping is a huge advantage; it reduces the pre-sales cost. Also, if priced attractively in tiers, it can lead to upsells (client starts with Bronze, then sees value and moves to Silver next year, etc.). A productized offer also gives a sense of tangible value to the client rather than just “days of consulting.” For example, saying “We will deliver X and Y within 4 weeks for Z dollars” is more compelling than an open-ended T&M quote.

Scalability: Perhaps the most strategic benefit – it’s easier to scale the business. If Mokai wanted to grow or even franchise its model, having documented, repeatable services is crucial. It’s the difference between being an artisanal shop and a well-oiled factory. For instance, if demand surges, Mokai could bring in additional contractors and have them execute the standard service playbooks to handle the volume – something that would be chaotic if every project was custom.

Higher Valuation: If Mokai ever seeks investment or aims to be acquired, productized services (with recurring revenue elements like retainers) typically make the company more attractive. It signals a stable, system-driven business. Consulting firms that are purely individual-expertise driven can be seen as less valuable since they rely on key people, whereas having “products” and systems suggests the business can run more independently of specific individuals.


One of the coaching experts, Michael Zipursky, notes that building leverage through productization and systems is a hallmark of an “entrepreneurial consultant” as opposed to just a freelancer. It transforms the practice into a business that can grow beyond the solo efforts.

3.3 Examples of Tiered Packages & Retainers

To illustrate what productized consulting looks like in practice, consider some examples (some drawn from industry, some hypothetical yet realistic for Mokai):

Virtual CISO Packages: As described, vCISO.One offers tiered advisory services – a smaller org might opt for a light touch (e.g. one executive meeting per month to review cyber posture), while a larger one might pay for a more hands-on approach (e.g. a few days a month of on-site work, policy development support, etc.). Each tier has a name and specific inclusions. For instance:

Basic vCISO: monthly report to the board + 2 calls;

Standard vCISO: everything in Basic plus quarterly on-site workshop and on-call incident guidance;

Comprehensive vCISO: acting as part of the leadership team with weekly engagements, custom policy development, etc.


These are often billed on a retainer (fixed monthly fee). The benefit to the client is they know their cost and get ongoing support; benefit to the firm is steady income and deeper client relationship.

Cybersecurity Maturity Assessment Tiers: Consider an Essential Eight service example from Virtuelle Group: they offer an Essential 8 managed service in tiered form, aligning to maturity levels 1, 2, 3. Their entry “Essentials” package might just get you to baseline (level 1) with basic policy and some hours (they indicated e.g. 4 hours). The higher packages include more policy development, strategy roadmap, and more hours of support (e.g. 20 hours plus covering multiple domains). They even list optional add-ons like cloud hardening or extra services to tailor the package. This granular approach shows clients exactly what they get at each level and allows upselling. Mokai could emulate this: for example, “Cyber Hygiene Package – Level 1” vs “Resilience Package – Level 3”, etc.

Penetration Testing Bundles: Some consultancies sell pen testing in packages: e.g. Web App PenTest Standard (up to X pages, automated + manual testing, with report), Web App PenTest Advanced (includes threat modeling workshop, deeper manual analysis, perhaps compliance mapping like OWASP ASVS), Continuous PenTest Service (subscription for quarterly testing cycles). Tiering by depth and frequency allows clients to pick based on their risk tolerance and budget.

Incident Response Retainer: A popular offering for firms is something like “Emergency Response Retainer.” The client pays a fixed fee annually which usually includes: being listed as a priority client for IR (guaranteed 1-hour response SLA), perhaps a certain number of hours of incident handling included, and value-add services like an annual incident readiness assessment. Tiered levels could offer more hours or proactive services (like training sessions, playbook development). Government agencies might like this model because it’s like insurance – they have someone on standby.

Training and Awareness Packages: If Mokai offers security training (phishing awareness, etc.), that can be packaged too (e.g. Bronze: one training session + phishing simulation; Silver: quarterly simulations + e-learning; Gold: fully managed awareness program).


One critical aspect when dealing with government clients: ensure packages map to their procurement methods. Government often has panels or pre-approved service lists with rate cards, but increasingly they also look for outcome-based engagements. Productized offerings can be pitched as outcomes (which government likes, as it defines deliverables clearly). Also, smaller government contracts might fall under thresholds where quoting a fixed price package is simpler than a complex proposal.

For example, an agency might just need an Essential 8 assessment to inform budget planning – a fixed price $15k “Essential 8 Health Check” package could be very attractive and easier to approve than an open-ended consultancy engagement.

3.4 Balancing Customization and Repeatability

A concern in productization is: “Every client is different – will a standard package really fit?” The answer is to build flexibility around a standard core.

Think of it like lego blocks: you have standard modules, and you can configure them as needed. Mokai’s operating model should allow some tailoring:

Custom Scope Add-ons: Define what the base product includes, but allow add-ons or extensions. E.g., the base pen test might exclude social engineering, but the client can add it for additional fee. This way the core process remains same, you just plug an extra step.

Parametrization: Within the standard approach, have parameters that can change. For instance, risk appetite of a client could be a parameter – your reporting template might have a section that adjusts recommendations based on whether the client is risk-averse or risk-tolerant, government or private, etc. The methodology can incorporate those variations logically (perhaps via decision trees or different templates for different sectors).

Client Input and Planning: Even with a productized service, start with a brief planning session with the client to understand any unique constraints. For example, in an Essential 8 uplift, one client might already have multi-factor auth broadly except for one legacy system – you’d adjust your recommendations slightly but you’re still covering all eight categories in your standard way.

Knowledge of Exceptions: Over time, Mokai will learn the typical 80% that’s common and the 20% that varies by client. Train consultants that “our standard deliverable covers X, Y, Z; if a client has an unusual need (like they want a particular compliance mapping in the report), here’s how we incorporate it without reinventing everything.” Possibly maintain a small library of “extensions” for the products.


It’s also acceptable to say no to customization that breaks the model. Part of productization discipline is staying within scope. If a client’s needs are truly unique, you can revert to a bespoke approach for that case (priced accordingly), or better yet, see if that unique need is likely to recur with others – if yes, consider developing a new product offering for it.

Small Firm Consideration: For a small firm like Mokai, one might worry that productization limits opportunities because you’re defining what you offer. But in reality, Mokai can still capture bespoke projects – you simply build them atop your product foundation. For example, if a client wants a “full cybersecurity transformation program,” Mokai could combine several productized modules (some assessment, some training, some technical uplift) into a customized package for that client. The internal pieces are still standard, you’re just assembling a bigger puzzle.

Finally, customization vs repeatability also ties to marketing: productization gives you a defined brandable service, but you should gather client feedback on whether those offerings resonate. If multiple clients keep asking for something slightly different, that’s a signal to tweak the standard. Being small means Mokai can be agile – refine the service catalogue every 6-12 months as needed.

In summary, productizing is about capturing your expertise in a scalable format. It doesn’t mean ignoring client context; it means you have a starting template for delivering value, which you then mildly tailor. This increases efficiency significantly while still delivering a targeted outcome. Mokai should gradually build a portfolio of such packaged services – this will set it apart from many one-off consulting shops and enable smoother growth.

4. Tactical Playbook for Mokai’s Operating Model

Bringing it all together, here’s a tactical step-by-step approach Mokai can use to document and build its operating model (essentially a condensed action plan):

Step 1: Baseline Current State (COM – Current Operating Model). Even if informal, write down how things are done today. Use headings of People, Process, Tech, etc:

List who is involved in the business now and their roles (e.g. Founder does sales and delivery, maybe one contractor used ad-hoc).

Document any process you currently follow – even if it’s just “we have a proposal template” or “we always do an outbrief meeting at project end.”

Note tools in use (e.g. Office 365, Nessus scanner, etc.).

Identify pain points or gaps. Maybe proposals take too long or quality is inconsistent or you worry about missing some compliance aspect. This analysis helps prioritize what to fix or implement first.


Step 2: Clarify Strategic Goals and Constraints. Confirm what Mokai wants to be in 1-3 years. For instance: “Be recognized in NSW government as a reliable Indigenous cybersecurity partner,” or “Achieve $X revenue with Y% coming from recurring services.” Also note constraints: small budget, owner also delivering projects (so limited time), etc. These will influence the operating model design (e.g. if the goal is government sector, then compliance and proper governance are non-negotiable parts of the model).

Step 3: Design the Target Operating Model. Use the frameworks to sketch it out:

Draw an Operating Model Canvas (as per Table 1, but refined for Mokai’s specifics).

Define the key components: People – decide which roles to have and which to outsource, Process – which SOPs to formalize first, Tech – any new tool needed, Governance – meeting cadence, any advisory board or mentor involvement, Finance – basic budgets and KPIs.

At this stage, keep it high-level and ensure it aligns to achieving strategic goals. For example, if a goal is ISO 27001 certification in a year, ensure the TOM includes building an ISMS and maybe assigning a security officer role (even if part-time).


Step 4: Implement in Phases. Rome wasn’t built in a day; similarly, don’t try to implement everything at once. Possibly:

Month 1-2: Finalize core SOPs (onboarding, quality, etc.) and use them on the next project. Also, set up basic tools (if new PM software is needed, get it configured).

Month 3-4: Focus on compliance – draft required policies for ISO 27001, start internal security improvements. Maybe also work on one productized service offering and launch it.

Month 5-6: Evaluate whether any hires or long-term contractor agreements are needed as business grows. Also, gather metrics and see if the operations are hitting targets (like project delivery times, client satisfaction).

And so on. Essentially iterate: design -> implement -> monitor -> refine.


Step 5: Engage Team and Stakeholders. For an indigenous-owned business, stakeholders could include community or elder advisors, investors, or partners aside from just team members. Communicate the operating model changes with them. For internal team (even if just a handful of people), involve them in refining SOPs – this improves buy-in and captures practical insights. If Mokai has a mentor or business coach (common in entrepreneur programs), review the model with them for feedback.

Step 6: Document Everything Accessibly. Create an “Ops Bible” – not hundreds of pages, but a concise collection of documents (store in a SharePoint or Google Drive for easy access). Keep version control (even just dates on docs). This not only helps current operations but also is invaluable when onboarding new team members or contractors. It shows professionalism.

Step 7: Monitor and Iterate. Set some operating metrics to watch:

e.g. Cycle time from proposal to project start (to see if operations are responsive),

% of projects delivered within budget,

of findings from quality reviews (with a goal to reduce rework),

contractor satisfaction (maybe informally checking if they felt supported by the process),

and client satisfaction (through post-engagement surveys).


Use these to identify where the operating model might need tweaks. Perhaps after a few projects you find the need for a better knowledge management tool – then implement that. Or you realize clients love a particular deliverable format – standardize it further.

Step 8: Mitigate Risks Proactively. Refer to the risk list below regularly. For each identified risk, ensure at least one mitigating control or plan is in place. For example, risk of contractor unavailability: mitigation might be maintain at least two people capable of each critical task (either two contractors or one employee + one contractor). If one is sick or leaves, you have backup. Embed such thinking into your planning.

Step 9: Leverage External Resources and Support. As an Indigenous business in Australia, Mokai can utilize support programs (there are government grants for capacity building, mentoring through Indigenous business networks, etc.). Some of these might help fund training or process improvement initiatives. Also, being part of professional bodies (like AISA – Australian Information Security Association) could provide templates or advice on operations. Government supplier programs might have guides on meeting procurement standards – follow those as a checklist (for instance, the NSW government might have a supplier guide that indirectly hints at things like needing certain insurances, which you incorporate into your operating model).

This playbook might seem detailed, but effectively it is: plan -> do -> check -> act, which is the continuous improvement cycle advocated by ISO standards. Mokai can start small but should always keep the end vision in mind: an agile yet robust operating model that instills confidence in clients and supports sustainable growth.

5. Risks in Contractor-Led Service Delivery & Mitigations

Operating with a contractor-centric model introduces specific risks. Below is a list of common risks and how Mokai can mitigate them:

Risk	Mitigation Strategies

Inconsistent Quality of Work (Different contractors may deliver varying quality)	– Develop detailed methodologies, templates, and checklists for all services to guide contractors. <br> – Implement a peer review and approval process for all major deliverables (internal QA by a senior team member ensures standards are met). <br> – Provide initial training/orientation to contractors on Mokai’s expectations and style. Regularly share feedback and best practices to align quality.
Intellectual Property (IP) Ownership Uncertainty (Who owns work product created by contractors)	– Use strong contract agreements that include work-for-hire or IP assignment clauses clearly transferring ownership of all deliverables to Mokai (or the client, as appropriate). <br> – Ensure contractors understand and sign these before starting work. <br> – Keep an inventory of deliverables and associated contracts to ensure IP is accounted for.
Confidentiality & Data Security Risks (Contractors handling sensitive client info)	– Require all contractors to sign NDAs and if possible, security policies agreements (acknowledging Mokai’s rules for data protection). <br> – Limit data access on a need-to-know basis: use secure IT systems where contractors only see their project’s data. <br> – Provide contractors with company-controlled accounts (email, etc.) that can be monitored and revoked. <br> – If feasible, conduct background checks or ensure contractors have at least baseline security clearance for government projects.
Contractor Availability & Continuity (Risk of a key contractor being unavailable or leaving mid-project)	– Maintain a bench of more than one contractor per key skill so you have backup options. <br> – Structure engagements so that knowledge is documented: e.g. require contractors to log progress in shared systems, so someone else can pick up if needed. <br> – For long projects, consider overlap: have two contractors share knowledge, or have an internal person shadow periodically. <br> – Use retainer agreements with critical contractors to secure a certain amount of their time over a period.
Client Relationship and Trust (Clients uneasy if they perceive a revolving door of consultants)	– Introduce contractors as part of “our team” to clients, highlighting their credentials (so client sees them as a valued extension of Mokai). <br> – Keep a consistent point of contact (e.g. an internal project manager or lead) for the client, even if delivery team members change. This person maintains continuity. <br> – Be transparent but positive: e.g. “We have a network of specialists, and for your engagement we’re bringing in X who has 10 years of experience in Y.” Emphasize benefit to client (specialist expertise) rather than the fact they’re external.
Lower Control Over Work Process (Contractors may use their own approach or tools, potentially clashing with firm’s processes)	– Onboard contractors thoroughly on Mokai’s SOPs and tools – make it clear they need to use the firm’s templates and follow defined processes. <br> – Provide necessary tool licenses or environments to contractors so they don’t use unapproved tools (e.g. give them accounts on your approved scanning tools or document systems). <br> – Include in contract or handbook: compliance with firm policies (e.g. no use of personal email for client work, follow secure handling procedures, etc.). <br> – Periodically audit or check work in progress (have project lead sit in on some meetings or review interim results). This helps catch deviations early.
Legal Compliance & Worker Classification (Risk of contractors being deemed employees or other legal issues)	– Ensure contractors are genuinely independent: allow them control in how work is done to a reasonable degree, avoid treating them exactly like employees in all ways (for legal distinction). <br> – Keep records of their invoices and payments (do not pay them via payroll). <br> – Have them carry their own insurance if possible, or explicitly cover them under yours and note that in contracts (to avoid uninsured liabilities). <br> – Stay aware of Australian Tax Office (ATO) and Fair Work guidelines on contractors; if ever in doubt (especially for long-term, full-time contractors), get professional advice or consider making them part-time employees to be safe.
Liability and Insurance Gaps (If a contractor makes a mistake, who is liable?)	– Maintain a professional indemnity insurance policy for Mokai that covers contractors’ work (many policies do if you notify insurer that you use contractors; some require contractors to have their own as well). <br> – Have clear indemnification clauses in contracts with both clients and contractors: e.g. contractor agrees to indemnify Mokai for negligence on their part, and Mokai’s contract with client limits Mokai’s liability in line with insurance. <br> – Quality control (as above) is the best prevention. Also, prefer contractors who are experienced/professional (and possibly carry their own coverage).
Reputation Risk (A contractor misrepresents themselves or behaves unprofessionally under Mokai’s banner)	– Vet contractors carefully (not just technical skill, but professionalism). Check references or past client feedback. <br> – Set expectations in onboarding about code of conduct, business ethics, and cultural values (particularly as an Indigenous-owned firm, emphasize any cultural protocols or values important to Mokai’s brand). <br> – Monitor client satisfaction closely. If any warning signs (missed deadlines, communication issues), address immediately with the contractor or replace if needed. <br> – Always have an official Mokai representative (employee or lead) overseeing engagements to manage any issues quickly.
Dependency on Key Contractors (The business could become too reliant on one or two star contractors)	– Cross-train or have those key contractors document their work thoroughly (so knowledge isn’t lost). <br> – If possible, bring critical expertise in-house over time (e.g. hire a full-time lead once finances allow, to reduce over-reliance on one external person). <br> – Build relationships with multiple experts in the same field (even if you primarily use one, have others you can call). <br> – Negotiate non-solicitation and perhaps exclusivity clauses with key contractors for certain clients or industries, to prevent them from getting poached or competing directly at least for a time.


Each of these risks is manageable with conscious effort. The overall theme is to turn what could be chaotic (lots of independent actors) into a synchronized operation through clear rules, oversight, and communication. Mokai’s nimbleness actually can be an advantage in managing risk: issues can be spotted and fixed quicker in a small team than in a huge firm. By addressing these risks proactively, Mokai can confidently leverage a contractor-powered model to deliver great results with minimal downside.
