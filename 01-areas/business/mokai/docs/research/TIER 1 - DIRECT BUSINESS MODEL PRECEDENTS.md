Tier 1: Direct Model Precedents – Indigenous Cyber/IT Firms & IPP Outcomes

Indigenous-Owned Cybersecurity/IT Consulting Firms Serving Government

Existence and Scale: Yes – multiple successful Indigenous-owned IT consultancies are serving Australian government clients, validating Mokai’s model. Examples include:

Willyama Services/Cyber: Founded 2016 by an Indigenous Army veteran (Kieran Hynes), grew to 50+ staff by 2022 with offices in Canberra, Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide. Willyama secured the largest Defence cyber security contract and launched a dedicated cyber division in 2022. The company is a prime contractor to Defence and aspires to be the first ASX-listed Indigenous business.

Baidam Solutions: Established 2018 by Indigenous founders, Baidam is a “profit-with-purpose” cyber firm recognized with multiple awards (e.g. AFR Fast 100 #30 in 2024). It operates nationwide and opened Australia’s first Indigenous-run Security Operations Centre in 2023. Baidam has partnerships with major clients (e.g. University of Queensland) and tech giants like Google. The company reinvests over 50% of profits into Indigenous community training and scholarships, indicating both strong performance and social impact focus.

Arrpwere: Founded ~2018 by Adrian Standish (an Aboriginal ex-Defence IT leader), Arrpwere Consulting Group serves Defence and federal agencies in ICT architecture, cybersecurity, and project services. It has a lean core team with multiple divisions – Consulting, People (staff augmentation), and Cyber (products/services). Arrpwere has grown with support from initiatives like Adam Goodes’ Indigenous Defence & Infrastructure Consortium (iDiC), and focuses on being a trusted prime contractor rather than a sub.

Goanna Solutions: An Indigenous majority-owned IT services and staffing firm (founded 2018), known as a leading digital solutions provider. Goanna offers labor-hire, software and hardware deployments, advisory consulting, and even cyber-security offerings. Its model leverages the Indigenous Procurement Policy (IPP) – clients use Goanna to meet supplier diversity targets while receiving quality IT services. Goanna has partnered with programs like AWS re/Start to train Indigenous tech talent, and expanded Australia-wide.

Others: Emerging firms like Intaris (est. 2021, Western Australia’s first Indigenous-owned cybersecurity firm) combine Indigenous ownership with veteran cyber leadership, using a partner-network delivery model. Smaller consultancies (e.g. Birrang Cyber, Booka Consulting) also exist, though on a modest scale. Importantly, these firms are all still operating (none have failed or exited yet) – in fact, several are scaling rapidly and winning industry accolades, which is a strong validation signal.


Operational Models: These Indigenous consultancies use lean permanent teams and extensive contractor or partner networks:

Flexible Workforce: Many rely on contractors or associates for delivery rather than large full-time payrolls. For example, Baidam offers “IT Recruitment” services alongside consulting, indicating a bench of on-call specialists. Arrpwere explicitly runs a People division for ICT staff augmentation. Intaris works with “a trusted network of leading technology and delivery providers” instead of only in-house staff. This recruitment-led model (small core team + contractor bench) is common and has been viable in these cases.

Service Offerings & Evolution: Most started with cybersecurity consulting/audits and expanded into adjacent services over time. Baidam, for instance, added managed security operations, product reselling, and cloud security services as it grew. Willyama spun off a dedicated cyber unit offering consulting, compliance audits, managed services, secure IT procurement, and training. Arrpwere combined technical consulting with recruitment services from the outset. This broadening of offerings helps capture more contract opportunities (including product resale revenue, though at lower margins).

Client Base: Government agencies constitute the bulk of clients. These firms leverage government panel appointments and the IPP preference to win federal work. Several also serve state governments and critical infrastructure sectors. Private sector clients are a secondary focus, though not absent – e.g. Baidam lists commercial partners and a university client (UQ), and Intaris targets critical infrastructure industry along with government. Still, 80%+ of revenue for most is government in early years, using vehicles like government procurement panels and set-asides.

Growth Trajectory: The precedents show that within ~3–5 years, an Indigenous consultancy can reach multi-million revenue and significant headcount if demand and execution are strong. Willyama went from zero to >50 staff in six years by riding Defence contracts, landing on high-growth lists and considering an IPO. Baidam in under 5 years won major awards and established offices in multiple cities. These suggest a capable Indigenous-led firm can scale quickly via government work – often faster than a comparable non-Indigenous startup would, due to the policy tailwind.


Key Success Factors Observed:

Founder Credentials: Strong industry experience and networks of the founders were crucial. Willyama’s founder had 13 years in military tech and a decade at Telstra/IBM/Dell, giving credibility to snag Defence deals. Arrpwere’s CEO had 25+ years in ICT including senior Defence roles. This expertise helped these companies win trust beyond their IPP status. Mokai’s team will likewise need solid credentials to reassure clients.

Leveraging IPP (Policy Advantage): The Indigenous Procurement Policy was a major enabler for all these firms. They aggressively pursued certification (Supply Nation registered, etc.) and marketed themselves as a solution for agencies to meet Indigenous spend targets while getting quality service. The data shows IPP opened many doors: since 2015, over $9.5 billion in federal contracts have been awarded to Indigenous businesses, via 64,000+ contracts to 3,900+ firms. In 2022-23 alone, ~1,400 Indigenous suppliers won 12,000 contracts totaling $1.4 billion. All agencies exceeded their 3% Indigenous procurement targets that year. This means a qualified Indigenous firm had a built-in edge in many tender processes. The precedent companies capitalized on that edge, often winning contracts set aside exclusively for Indigenous vendors or benefiting from a narrower field of competitors.

Partnerships & Alliances: Successful firms formed strategic partnerships. Baidam, for example, forged alliances with major cybersecurity vendors and with Google (for talent pathways). Willyama partnered with Defence and also created an Indigenous business hub to collaborate with other Indigenous companies. These partnerships expanded capabilities and credibility. Many also got mentorship/contracts via the Indigenous Defence & Infrastructure Consortium or Supply Nation’s network. Being plugged into the right networks was a force-multiplier for growth.

Quality and Reputation: These firms delivered results and built a reputation for excellence, which in turn led to larger contracts. Several won industry awards not just as Indigenous businesses but for cybersecurity itself (e.g. Baidam won “Cyber Security Business of the Year 2025”). Clients saw that engaging an Indigenous firm didn’t mean compromising on quality – in some cases, these firms were leading-edge. For instance, Willyama is the official DISP (Defence Industry Security Program) cyber provider, indicating top-tier security clearance and trust. Baidam’s case studies (like securing the University of QLD) show they offer “industry-leading” solutions on par with mainstream competitors. This reputation building is key to long-term viability beyond the initial IPP-facilitated work.

Social Impact Mission: A strong social mission (Indigenous employment and community give-back) actually provided a competitive edge. Government clients and partners were drawn to the dual benefit of solving a problem and contributing to Indigenous advancement. For example, Willyama created 15+ Indigenous jobs and was publicly praised by the ACT Chief Minister for its community impact. Baidam’s “Bridging the Gap” initiative and scholarships for Indigenous STEM students not only address workforce gaps but also make clients feel part of a positive story. This enhances client loyalty and often garners free publicity. It also helps attract top Indigenous talent to the firm. Mokai should note that a genuine commitment to Indigenous development isn’t just altruism – it’s a business strength when serving government.


Challenges and Lessons Learned:

Breaking In Takes Time: Even with IPP, early-stage hurdles were real. Firms needed relevant certifications and clearances to win government trust (e.g. Willyama obtained DISP accreditation to handle classified Defence work). Building a track record was critical – many started with small subcontracts or low-risk tasks before winning prime contracts. Networking via programs like Supply Nation and IDIC was often necessary to get those first opportunities. Lesson: Mokai should leverage every support mechanism (certifications, mentors, pilot projects) to overcome the initial credibility gap.

Cash Flow & Capital: Rapid growth through contractor-based delivery can strain finances. While specific financials aren’t public, it’s known that government payment cycles (even with 20-day terms) can create working capital gaps when paying contractors weekly/monthly. Successful firms likely managed this by staging growth (scaling up only after securing contracts) and possibly tapping Indigenous business funding programs for loans/guarantees. No precedent company appears VC-funded; most growth was organic, but access to short-term finance (e.g. invoice financing or IBA loans) might have been a behind-the-scenes factor enabling them to take on big projects without cash crises. Lesson: Plan conservatively for cash flow; consider seeking IBA or other funding early for buffer.

Quality Control of Contractors: Relying on a contractor network means maintaining consistent service quality is challenging. The precedents mitigated this by having seasoned in-house leaders overseeing work and by selecting known, trusted contractors (often ex-government or ex-military specialists). For instance, Intaris highlights that it’s “led by national cyber leaders” and delivers via trusted partners to ensure quality. Arrpwere brought on very experienced leads in architecture, cyber, program management, etc., to guide project delivery. Nonetheless, a few Indigenous firms in other sectors have faced issues of inconsistent quality when over-relying on ad-hoc contractors. Lesson: Mokai must implement strong vetting, training, and oversight for any contractors carrying its brand to maintain a solid reputation.

Avoiding “Black Cladding” Traps: Black cladding – when a non-Indigenous company uses an Indigenous figurehead or JV to win IPP contracts – has been an issue in the ecosystem. The successful companies distinguished themselves by authenticity and transparency. They were clearly Indigenous-owned (majority share by Indigenous founders) and actively led by Indigenous executives, leaving no doubt. Government is tightening rules to curb fake Indigenous entities (requiring 51%+ Indigenous ownership/control for IPP eligibility). The lesson is twofold: (1) Mokai should proudly advertise its Indigenous ownership and leadership, and perhaps get certified to the new higher standards to assure clients it’s a genuine Indigenous business. (2) Be prepared to compete with some “front” companies in bids – i.e. price aggressively and emphasize capability, not just status, to beat those who might rely on status alone.

Sustainability and Life Balance: While not heavily documented publicly, running these fast-growing firms is undoubtedly demanding. Anecdotally, founders are juggling delivery, business development, and community commitments. The fact that none of the profiled founders have stepped away and instead are doubling down (e.g. Hynes aiming for IPO expansion, Standish continuing to grow Arrpwere) suggests they find the business rewarding, but it can be all-consuming. There’s an implicit lesson about founder burnout risk – building a core team (the way Willyama did by hiring executives as it grew) may be necessary to avoid overload as contracts scale up.


Would They Do It Again? By all indications, yes. These founders express pride in both the business success and the impact on their communities. For example, Willyama’s founder speaks of enabling veterans and Indigenous people to prosper in tech careers, which was a key reason he started the company. Baidam’s founders similarly centered the company on creating a legacy of more Indigenous cyber professionals. The combination of profit and purpose seems to lead to high satisfaction. None of the major players have exited by selling out to non-Indigenous corporates (even when Big4 firms have shown interest in Indigenous consulting arms), implying they see long-term value in staying independent and growing.

However, they would likely caution new entrants that success is not automatic. Common advice in the Indigenous business community is: “Don’t expect contracts just because you’re Indigenous; you need to be competitive and excellent in delivery.” The precedents show that IPP can open the first door, but repeat business and growth come from performance and relationship-building. In summary, these firms prove the model can work and be highly profitable and impactful – but the founders earned that success through industry know-how, leveraging the IPP smartly, and delivering quality. Mokai can proceed with a qualified yes that the model is viable, keeping in mind these critical success factors and pitfalls.

IPP Preference Reality Check

The Indigenous Procurement Policy (IPP) has materially boosted Indigenous business participation in government contracts, but it has nuances:

Contract Win Rates and Share: Indigenous businesses now win a significant share of Commonwealth contracts thanks to IPP. All federal portfolios have consistently exceeded the target of awarding 3% of contracts to Indigenous suppliers (and 1.75% of total contract value) in recent years. In FY 2022-23, Indigenous firms secured over 12,000 contracts worth $1.4 billion, which was ~6.5% of federal procurement by number of contracts and around 5% by value – far above the minimum targets. By comparison, before IPP (pre-2015), Indigenous businesses won only a tiny fraction of government work. This demonstrates a real preference in action. Agencies are motivated to contract with Indigenous suppliers – it’s become “business as usual” to include Indigenous businesses in procurement.

Does IPP give an advantage? Yes, undeniably, but primarily for those who are procurement-ready. The IPP includes a Mandatory Set-Aside (MSA): for most procurements between $80k and $200k (and any remote-area contracts), officials must first consider Indigenous suppliers before opening to others. This led to hundreds of extra contracts each year for Indigenous SMEs – e.g. in 2021-22, ~6.9% of AusTender-listed contracts in that band went to Indigenous businesses under the set-aside. Even above that band, there’s Indirect Preference: agencies have annual Indigenous spend targets, creating strong incentive to choose an Indigenous firm if one is close in capability and price. Many tender RFPs now explicitly encourage Indigenous participation, and some panel contracts reserve spots for Indigenous providers. The result is effectively a higher win probability for Indigenous bidders in many scenarios. For example, the Commonwealth overall exceeded its FY22/23 contract count target by 684% (14,747 Indigenous contracts vs 1,881 expected), meaning agencies went well beyond the minimum – a sign that once engaged, Indigenous firms tend to keep winning more work.

Quality of Contracts: A critical point – what kind of contracts are Indigenous firms getting? Early on, a lot were in areas like facilities, construction, admin services, where it was easier for agencies to channel spend. In ICT and consulting, Indigenous firms initially got smaller or niche contracts (e.g. a single penetration test project, or supplying a specific software license via resale). However, as the Indigenous business sector has matured, they are winning more substantial, strategic contracts. For instance, Willyama’s Defence cyber contract shows that complex, high-value work can go to an Indigenous firm. Similarly, Baidam’s role as a security services provider to large enterprises suggests it’s not just token work. That said, there is still a skew: by value, the largest chunks of IPP contracts overall are in construction/infrastructure and some in commodities. Cybersecurity consulting is a smaller slice of the pie, so competition among Indigenous cyber firms for those contracts can be fierce (there may be only a dozen sizable cyber consulting contracts a year set aside, whereas there are thousands of smaller ICT task orders). Realistic expectation: IPP will likely help Mokai win initial contracts (say under $200k each) relatively quickly if positioned well, but scaling to big $1M+ projects may still require proving themselves against both Indigenous and non-Indigenous competitors.

Data on Win Rates: Precise win-rate data (i.e. bids submitted vs won) for Indigenous firms isn’t published, but a proxy can be inferred. The success rate for Indigenous businesses in competitive tenders appears higher than average. Many IPP contracts are awarded through limited tenders or directed sourcing to Indigenous suppliers (especially under MSA rules), which have a much higher win probability than open tenders. The government has reported that in certain departments, 100% of procurements under the threshold went to Indigenous suppliers because of set-aside enforcement. Where open competition occurs, an Indigenous bidder that meets requirements can effectively act as a front-runner due to the agency’s internal KPIs. In short, an Indigenous firm with the necessary capabilities probably has a markedly better chance of winning government work than an equivalent non-Indigenous firm, all else equal. This is the fundamental premise of Mokai’s strategy, and it is borne out by the outcomes so far.

Real-World Examples: Beyond the data, case examples illustrate IPP’s impact:

Indigenous IT firms winning panels: Several Indigenous tech companies (like those above) have secured spots on major government panels (e.g. Digital Marketplace, Defence ICT panels, ACSC cyber panels) even as newcomers. Once on the panel, they often get a steady stream of work.

Set-aside contracts: The Department of Defence, for instance, has used set-asides to sole-source cyber training and assessment engagements to Indigenous businesses as part of meeting its targets (Defence awarded $680M+ to Indigenous suppliers in 2022-23 alone).

Reseller arrangements: Agencies sometimes fulfill hardware/software procurement needs via an Indigenous intermediary. E.g., an Indigenous IT firm might resell a Microsoft or cybersecurity product (earning a margin) because it helps the agency count that spend toward IPP goals. This can be a lucrative secondary revenue stream (Willyama and Baidam both list “Technology Fulfilment” or product reselling as part of their services). It’s essentially business that Indigenous companies might not win on open competition (since the product is the same), but the IPP gives them a leg up to be the chosen channel.


Cautionary Notes: IPP isn’t a panacea:

“Black Cladding”: As mentioned, there have been abuses. Some large firms create pseudo-Indigenous subsidiaries or use Indigenous figureheads (“rent-a-Indigenous-company”) to capture contracts. This can siphon opportunities away from genuine Indigenous SMEs. The government is responding by tightening rules (requiring 51% Indigenous ownership/control, and promising crackdowns on phony structures). In the meantime, real Indigenous businesses like Mokai must be prepared to differentiate themselves by emphasizing genuine Indigenous leadership and community engagement to assure clients and avoid being seen with suspicion.

Concentration Risk: Relying almost solely on government/IPPs means if policies change or agency budgets tighten, the business could suffer. The IPP target was recently raised (to 3% value by 2027, up from 1.75%) which is positive, but there’s always political risk. Also, some agencies meet targets easily and may become complacent, allocating the easy contracts to Indigenous firms but not extending into more mission-critical projects. The data shows a lot of contracts by count, but 63% of total federal procurement value still bypasses any Indigenous participation requirements (often due to exemptions for very large projects). So, Indigenous firms are competing within a subset of the procurement landscape. Mokai should plan for eventual diversification (e.g. into private sector or by developing its own IP) once established, to reduce over-reliance on the policy environment.

Capability Proof: If an Indigenous business fails to deliver, the IPP won’t save it from losing contracts. In fact, a few high-profile failures by any Indigenous supplier could sour an agency’s willingness to use new Indigenous vendors. The onus is on each firm to perform. The precedents succeeded in part because they did not misuse the advantage – they backed it up with strong execution. IPP might win Mokai the first contract faster, but keeping and growing that work will demand quality and relationship management equivalent to any competitor.

Margin Considerations: IPP contracts, especially those set aside or limited tender, often have less competitive pressure on price – this is good for margin. However, as more Indigenous providers enter the field (competition among Indigenous SMEs is growing), pricing will tighten. Also, some IPP-driven opportunities (like product resale) are low-margin (5-15%) businesses, essentially volume plays that can strain cash flow. The successful companies balanced services vs. resale to ensure profitability. Mokai should be selective in opportunities – not every IPP-favored contract is good business (e.g. a very slim-margin resale deal just to book revenue might not be wise unless it leads to services work).



Bottom Line: The IPP does translate to actual contract wins – it has proven to be a powerful catalyst for Indigenous startups in professional services. For Mokai, this means the door to government cybersecurity projects is open wider than it would be for others. The model of an Indigenous-owned prime contractor is not only viable, it has been successful for several others under IPP. The critical success factors will be ensuring Mokai is procurement-ready (certifications, clear value prop), networked into the Indigenous business community and government buyer circles, and capable of delivery once opportunities come. The evidence so far gives a strong affirmative that Mokai’s business model can work, *provided the lessons from earlier players are applied.*
