## **First Year Profit Projections**

Based on research data, here's what you can realistically expect:

---

## **The Math: Contractor Model Margins**

### **Industry Standard Margins (From Research)**

**Consulting firms using contractors:**

- **Gross margin**: 50-100% markup on contractor rates
- **Net profit margin**: 20-40% after all overheads
- **Typical split**: Bill client ~2x what you pay contractor

**Example:**

- Contractor rate: $800/day
- Client billing rate: $1,600/day
- Gross margin: $800/day (100%)
- After overheads: ~$560-640/day net (35-40%)

### **Cybersecurity Contractor Rates (From Research)**

| Specialty                      | Contractor Day Rate | Client Billing Rate | Your Margin/Day  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Essential Eight Consultant** | $800-900            | $1,600-1,800        | $640-720 (40%)   |
| **IRAP Assessor**              | $1,200-1,600        | $2,200-2,800        | $880-1,120 (40%) |
| **Pen Tester**                 | $1,000-1,300        | $1,800-2,400        | $720-960 (40%)   |
| **GRC Consultant**             | $800-1,300          | $1,600-2,400        | $640-960 (40%)   |

## **Key Insights from Research**

### **1. Margins Are Real (20-40% Standard)**

Research shows:

> "Aim for 50-100% gross margin on contractors, which typically translates to about 30-40% net profit after overhead"

> "Even at a strong 80% gross margin on contractors, by the time you account for all overheads, the realistic net was 35-40%"

**MOKAI can expect 20-40% net margins if you:**

- Bill contractors at 2x their rate
- Keep overhead lean (no office, cloud-based, minimal staff)
- Focus on high-value services (IRAP, Essential Eight) vs commodity pen testing

### **2. IPP Contracts Have Better Margins**

Research notes:

> "IPP contracts, especially those set aside or limited tender, often have less competitive pressure on price – this is good for margin"

**Translation**: Your Indigenous status means less price competition = healthier margins on set-aside contracts ($80K-$200K range).

### **3. Contractor Model = Lean & Profitable**

> "You avoid the fixed costs of employees (salaries, leave, idle time) – you only pay contractors when you have revenue. This flexibility actually protects profitability during slow periods"

**Year 1 advantage**: No salary obligations means profit = revenue minus actual costs. If you have slow months, costs drop proportionally.

## **Founder Compensation Reality Check**

### **Year 1: Likely Unpaid or Low Pay**

Research from Indigenous firm trajectories:

- **Year 1**: Founders often reinvest everything, take minimal salary
- **Baidam**: Reinvested 50% of profits into community (they still took salary from other 50%)
- **Willyama**: Hynes likely lived lean Year 1 to fund growth

**Your Year 1 options:**

 

**Option A: Reinvest Everything**

- $300K revenue → $78K profit → reinvest into Year 2 marketing, certifications, working capital
- Founders take $0 salary, live on savings/side income
- **Aggressive growth play** (Willyama model)

**Option B: Modest Salary**

- $300K revenue → $78K profit → split $26K each ($2,170/month each)
- Not livable in Sydney, but supplements other income
- **Balanced growth**

**Option C: Livable Salary (requires $500K+ revenue)**

- $500K revenue → $107K profit → split $35,700 each ($2,975/month)
- Still below market, but workable if you have low expenses
- **Sustainable growth**

## **The Brutal Truth About Year 1**

### **Comparison to Established Firms**

**Baidam (Year 5):**

- Revenue: Estimated $2-3M (based on SOC operations + staff size)
- Profit: ~$1-1.5M (50% margin on high-value services)
- Founders likely taking $150K-200K salary + profit distribution

**Willyama (Year 5):**

- Revenue: $6.3M
- Profit: ~$1.8-2.5M (30-40% margin)
- Hynes likely taking $200K+ salary + profit distribution

**MOKAI Year 1:**

- Revenue: $150K-500K (realistic range)
- Profit: $35K-107K (23-26% margin)
- Founders: $0-$35K each ($0-2,975/month)

---

## **What This Means Practically**

### **You're NOT Getting Rich Year 1**

If you hit $300K revenue (realistic target):

- Net profit: $78K
- Split 3 ways: $26K each
- **That's $2,170/month per person**

**Reality:**

- Not enough to live on in Sydney
- Likely need side income, savings, or partner's income
- This is a **startup sacrifice** period

### **But Year 2-3 Changes Everything**

Research shows Indigenous firms often:

- **Year 1**: $100K-300K revenue, minimal founder pay
- **Year 2**: $500K revenue (2-3x growth), modest salaries possible
- **Year 3**: $1M-2M revenue, founders taking market salaries + profit distributions

**If you hit $1M revenue Year 3:**

- Net profit: ~$300K-400K (30-40% margin)
- Split 3 ways: ~$100K-133K each
- **Now you're making real money**

---

## **Critical Success Factors for Profitability**

### **1. Price Aggressively**

- Research: "Bill clients roughly double what you pay the contractor"
- Don't underprice to win work (kills margins)
- IPP preference means you can charge market rates

### **2. Focus on High-Margin Services**

- **IRAP assessments**: $40K-80K contracts, 35-40% margin
- **Essential Eight uplift**: $50K-100K projects, 30-35% margin
- **Avoid**: Vendor resale (5-15% margin), commodity pen testing (competitive = thin margins)

### **3. Keep Overhead Lean**

- No office Year 1 (work from home/cafes)
- Cloud-based tools only
- No full-time hires until $500K+ revenue
- Minimal marketing spend (lean on Supply Nation networks, word-of-mouth)

### **4. Cash Flow Management**

- Invoice clients immediately (NET 20-30 days)
- Pay contractors weekly/biweekly (you hold cash 10-20 days = buffer)
- Use IBA loans if needed for working capital gaps
- Don't scale faster than cash allows

## **Bottom Line: What to Expect**

|Metric|Conservative|Realistic|Optimistic|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Year 1 Revenue**|$150K|$300K|$500K|
|**Net Profit**|$35K|$78K|$107K|
|**Your Share (÷3)**|$11,700|$26,000|$35,700|
|**Monthly Income**|$975|$2,170|$2,975|

**Translation:**

- ❌ **Not livable** as sole income Year 1
- ✅ **Livable** if you have side income, partner's income, or savings
- ✅ **Becomes real business** Year 2-3 at $500K-$1M revenue
