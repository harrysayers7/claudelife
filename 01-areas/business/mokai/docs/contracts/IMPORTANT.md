### 1. **Constitution** ✅ CRITICAL

- **Why**: Supply Nation requires proof of Indigenous ownership structure (51%+ Indigenous ownership and control)
- **Status**: Draft exists, needs completion
- **Priority**: HIGHEST - this is a core registration requirement

### 2. **Shareholders Agreement (SHA)** ✅ CRITICAL

- **Why**: Demonstrates Indigenous control mechanisms and governance
- **Status**: Multiple versions exist (MOKAI-SHA-V2.md is most recent)
- **Priority**: HIGHEST - proves both ownership AND control

### 3. **Board Resolution** ✅ IMPORTANT

- **Why**: Confirms officer appointments and Indigenous representation
- **Status**: Draft exists
- **Priority**: HIGH - shows Indigenous participation in management

## Can Wait Until After Registration

### 4. **Employment Agreement (COO)** ⏳ CAN WAIT

- **Why**: Not directly required for Supply Nation certification
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - important for operations but not registration-critical

### 5. **Contractor Agreement** ⏳ CAN WAIT

- **Why**: Operational document, not ownership/control evidence
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - needed before engaging contractors

### 6. **Services Agreement** ⏳ CAN WAIT

- **Why**: Client-facing contract template
- **Priority**: LOW - needed before taking clients, not registration

### 7. **IP Assignment & Confidentiality Deed** ⏳ CAN WAIT

- **Why**: Internal IP management
- **Priority**: LOW - good practice but not registration-critical

### 8. **Deed of Indemnity** ⏳ CAN WAIT

- **Why**: Director protection mechanism
- **Priority**: LOW - prudent but not registration-required
