## 6. PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY OF KEY ADAPTATIONS

### Business Activity Definition
**What it means**: Instead of aviation services, the company provides cybersecurity consulting and acts as a prime contractor managing subcontractors and vendor relationships.

**Why MOKAI needs it**: Accurately reflects the actual business model and enables proper governance of subcontractor relationships that are central to the business.

**How it differs from 18fifty3**: Much broader scope including subcontractor management, vendor partnerships, and potential SaaS product development rather than direct service delivery.

**Future implications**: Enables expansion into SaaS products, technology licensing, and international markets without requiring agreement amendments.

### Security Clearance Requirements
**What it means**: Major shareholders must obtain and maintain government security clearances, with consequences for voting rights and information access if clearances lapse.

**Why MOKAI needs it**: Government cybersecurity contracts often require cleared personnel, and clearance loss could eliminate major revenue streams.

**How it differs from 18fifty3**: Completely new concept not relevant to aviation/construction business.

**Future implications**: Ensures business continuity for government contracts but may limit potential shareholders to those eligible for clearances.

### IP Ownership Framework
**What it means**: Clear rules about who owns cybersecurity tools, methodologies, and other intellectual property developed by the company or shareholders.

**Why MOKAI needs it**: Cybersecurity consulting generates valuable IP that could become standalone products or licensing opportunities.

**How it differs from 18fifty3**: Aviation services typically don't generate significant IP, so this is a major new consideration.

**Future implications**: Enables monetization of IP through licensing, SaaS products, or spin-off companies while protecting shareholder interests.

### Competition Restraint Scope
**What it means**: Former shareholders are restricted from competing with MOKAI in cybersecurity services across Australia for a defined period.

**Why MOKAI needs it**: Protects client relationships, IP, and competitive advantage in a specialized market.

**How it differs from 18fifty3**: Expanded geographic scope (NSW/ACT to Australia-wide) reflecting national government market and potential for remote service delivery.

**Future implications**: Provides competitive protection but may limit ability to attract shareholders who have existing cybersecurity interests.

### Subcontractor Governance
**What it means**: Formal processes for selecting, managing, and monitoring subcontractors who deliver services under the MOKAI brand.

**Why MOKAI needs it**: Prime contractor model means MOKAI is responsible for subcontractor performance and quality to clients.

**How it differs from 18fifty3**: Much more comprehensive framework needed due to reliance on subcontractor delivery model.

**Future implications**: Enables scalable growth through subcontractor network while maintaining quality control and client satisfaction.

## 7. SHAREHOLDER DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

### Fundamental Structure Questions
1. **Shareholding Structure**: Should we maintain equal shareholding or create different classes of shares for different types of contributions?

2. **Voting Thresholds**: What percentage should trigger drag-along rights (18fifty3 uses 85% - appropriate for MOKAI)?

3. **Indigenous Ownership**: What mechanisms do we need to ensure Indigenous ownership stays above 51% for IPP eligibility?

4. **Future Investment**: How should we structure for potential external investment while maintaining Indigenous control?

### Security and Clearance Questions
5. **Security Clearances**: Should security clearances be mandatory for all shareholders or only those above a certain percentage holding?

6. **Clearance Failure**: What happens if a shareholder loses security clearance - suspension of rights or forced sale of shares?

7. **Classified Information**: How do we handle voting on matters involving classified information that not all shareholders can access?

### Business Operations Questions
8. **Competition Restraint**: Should geographic scope be NSW/ACT (like 18fifty3) or Australia-wide given our national market?

9. **Existing Business Interests**: What exemptions are needed for existing roles (MOK HOUSE, other ventures) from competition restraints?

10. **Subcontractor Management**: What level of subcontractor contracts should require board approval vs management discretion?

11. **Vendor Relationships**: How should revenue sharing work on vendor partnership deals where MOKAI earns commissions?

### Intellectual Property Questions
12. **IP Ownership**: Should all IP developed during consulting engagements be owned by the company or shared with individual developers?

13. **SaaS Products**: If we develop software tools from our consulting work, who owns them and how are profits shared?

14. **Pre-existing IP**: How do we handle IP that shareholders bring to the company vs develop during employment?

### Financial and Risk Questions
15. **Insurance Requirements**: What minimum coverage levels for professional indemnity and cyber liability insurance?

16. **Liability Allocation**: Should shareholders have joint and several liability for company debts or limited liability?

17. **Capital Contributions**: Should additional capital contributions be mandatory or optional when business expansion requires funding?

### Management and Governance Questions
18. **Management Structure**: CEO vs Managing Director structure, and should we have an advisory board for technical expertise?

19. **Conflict Resolution**: What dispute resolution mechanisms for deadlocks between shareholders?

20. **Exit Strategies**: Under what circumstances should forced sale provisions apply, and how should company valuation be determined?
