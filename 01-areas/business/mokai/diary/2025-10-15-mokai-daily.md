## What I Did Today

- Implemented auto-diary capture hook for automatic logging
-   I read a little bit of the operations guide, but I was going through it and highlighting certain areas. When I went back later to look, all those had been erased, so I don't know what I highlighted. Which is super frustrating and I'm pretty fucking pissed off.
