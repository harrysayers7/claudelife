# MOKAI Daily Note - Oct 14, 2025

## What I Did Today
- Had ultra-think session with Claude about MOKAI tracking system
- Set up dashboard and slash commands
- Learned about the 3-phase plan

## 💡 Learnings
- Operations Guide is key to sounding credible
- Essential Eight is easiest first service to sell
- Need to wait for Jack's family trust before registering

## 🏆 Wins
- Created MOKAI dashboard system
- Clarified ownership split (51% Indigenous)
- Kelly's website almost done

## 🚨 Blockers
- Waiting on Jack's family trust setup
- Haven't started Operations Guide reading yet

## 📝 Context/Updates
- Jack has contractor network ready to go
- Sales confidence still low (1/10) but Jack will lead initially
- Have 5-7 hours/day to dedicate to MOKAI learning

## 🎯 Tomorrow's Focus
- Start reading Indigenous Business & Procurement section of Ops Guide
- Do first flashcard review session
