## Why This File Exists

**Purpose**: Keep the big picture in mind without getting overwhelmed

**Usage**:
- Glance at it if you feel lost
- Read it fully on Day 30 to plan Phase 2 details
- Update it as reality changes

**Don't**:
- Read this daily (causes anxiety about things you can't control yet)
- Try to execute Phase 2/3 actions before Phase 1 is done
- Worry if things don't go exactly to this plan

---

## Key Principles

1. **One phase at a time**: Focus on Phase 1 until Day 30
2. **Adapt to reality**: We'll rebuild Phase 2 plan based on what actually happened
3. **Trust the process**: Learning now = faster execution later
4. **Stay present**: Today's work compounds into tomorrow's success

**Next Review Date**: Day 30 (approx. Nov 14, 2025)
