# Jack's Business Pricing Explained (Like You're 15)

Okay, so Jack explained two different ways Mokai makes money. Think of it like this:

[[Reselling Software (The Middleman Method)]]

## **Way 2: Professional Services (Hiring People to Do Work)**

This is more complicated because you're paying actual people to work.

**Example: Hiring a cybersecurity expert**

Let's say the expert charges **$1,000 per day**.

**But Mokai has to add extra costs on top:**

1. **The expert's rate:** $1,000/day
2. **Payroll tax:** A sneaky government tax on wages (around 6% once you earn enough) [[mokai-important]]
    - Jack says this is "an absolute bitch" because people forget about it
    - If you go over a threshold, you suddenly owe it and it can "really fuck you"
3. **Mokai's operating costs:**
    - Insurance (cyber liability, professional indemnity)
    - Salaries (maybe Harry, Jack, Kelly)
    - Email, website hosting
    - Office stuff

**So if the expert costs $1,000/day, Mokai might charge the client $1,300/day:**

- $1,000 goes to the expert
- $60 covers payroll tax
- $240 covers Mokai's costs + profit

## **The Trust & Tax Strategy**

This part is about how they'll pay themselves:

**Revenue stages:**

1. **$0-200k revenue:** Pay yourselves almost nothing, keep money in the business
2. **$200k-500k revenue:** Pay minimum salaries only
3. **$500k+ revenue:** Pay proper salaries

**Why?**

- Salaries = taxed heavily
- Dividends (profits from the business) = taxed less
- BUT: If you pay ZERO salary and only dividends, the tax office (ATO) might investigate you

**The trust part:** Instead of owning the business directly (51% Harry, 49% Jack), they'll set up trusts that own the business. This is for tax reasons - accountants can split income cleverly to minimize taxes.

## **Key Setup Steps Jack Mentioned**

1. ‚úÖ **Domain & email** (Harry got .com.au domain, Microsoft 365)
2. ‚è≥ **Wait for DNS to work** (technical internet stuff)
3. üîÑ **Set up trusts** (Jack needs to do this first)
4. üîÑ **Incorporate the business** (make it official)
5. üîÑ **Apply for government panels** when they reopen
6. üîÑ **Get Supply Nation certification** (proves you're Indigenous business)

---

## **Bottom Line**

Jack's basically saying:

- **Products:** Buy for $100k, sell for $110k ‚Üí pocket $10k
- **Services:** Expert costs $1k/day, but add taxes + your costs + profit ‚Üí charge $1.3k/day
- **Get on government panels** ‚Üí way easier to sell to government
- **Use trusts & minimize salaries** ‚Üí pay less tax legally

**The sneaky "gotcha" Jack warned about:** Payroll tax! Most people forget to include it, then get a huge surprise bill from the government later. Jack says to always include it in your cost calculations even if you're under the threshold, so you don't get screwed.
