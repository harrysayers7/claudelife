## Reselling Software (The Middleman Method)

**How it works:**

1. Government wants to buy software (let's say Microsoft licenses)
2. They ask Mokai: "Can you get us a quote?"
3. Mokai asks a distributor: "How much for this software?"
4. Distributor says: "$100,000"
5. Mokai tells the government: "$110,000" (adding $10k on top)
6. Government says yes and pays Mokai $110,000
7. Mokai pays the distributor $100,000
8. Mokai keeps the $10,000 difference

**The simple version:** You're like a middleman. Buy low, sell slightly higher, keep the difference. Jack mentioned 10-15% margin (that's the profit markup).
