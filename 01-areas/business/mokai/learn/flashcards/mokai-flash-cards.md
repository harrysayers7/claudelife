# Mokai Deep Research - Flashcards

## Procurement & Policy

What is the IPP (Indigenous Procurement Policy)?;;A mandatory policy requiring federal agencies to consider Indigenous businesses for contracts, with direct procurement available under $80,000 and set-asides for larger contracts up to $200,000.
*In simple terms: Government agencies MUST look at Indigenous businesses first for contracts. Under $80K they can hire directly, $80K-$200K they must consider Indigenous suppliers before anyone else.*
<!--SR:!2025-10-12,2,247-->

What is Exemption 16 in Commonwealth Procurement Rules?;;Allows direct procurement from Indigenous businesses without open tender for contracts under $200,000 (increased from $80,000 in 2024).
*In simple terms: Government can skip the normal competitive bidding process and directly hire an Indigenous business for contracts up to $200K. This was doubled from $80K in 2024.*

What is the Mandatory Set-Aside (MSA) threshold?;;$80,000-$200,000 range where officials must first consider Indigenous suppliers before opening procurement to others.
*In simple terms: For contracts between $80K-$200K, government MUST give Indigenous businesses first chance before asking other companies. Think of it as "reserved parking" for Indigenous suppliers.*
<!--SR:!2025-10-13,3,266-->

What are the current IPP targets for federal agencies?;;3% of procurement by contract count rising to 4% by 2029-30, with 1.75% minimum by contract value.
*In simple terms: Government agencies must award at least 3% of their total contracts (counting number of contracts) to Indigenous businesses, increasing to 4% by 2029. Also, at least 1.75% of the dollar value spent must go to Indigenous businesses.*

What percentage of federal procurement did Indigenous businesses win in FY 2022-23?;;Over 12,000 contracts worth $1.4 billion, representing ~6.5% by count and 5% by value.
*In simple terms: Indigenous businesses won 12,000+ government contracts worth $1.4 billion in one year. That's about 1 in every 15 contracts (6.5%) and $1 in every $20 spent (5%). This actually exceeds the government's own targets!*

What is the Digital Marketplace Panel?;;Federal procurement platform where Indigenous businesses can secure panel positions for steady work streams.
*In simple terms: Like an approved supplier list for government digital/IT work. Once you're on the panel, agencies can hire you directly without public tender, giving you regular ongoing work.*

What is "Black Cladding"?;;Fraudulent practice where non-Indigenous companies use Indigenous figureheads or structures to falsely win IPP contracts.
*In simple terms: When fake Indigenous businesses are created just to get government contracts. Like putting an Indigenous person's name on the paperwork but the real business is owned and run by non-Indigenous people. It's illegal and damages genuine Indigenous businesses.*

What is the 51% ownership requirement?;;From 2026, Indigenous businesses must demonstrate 51%+ Indigenous ownership/control to qualify for IPP preferences.
*In simple terms: Starting 2026, to qualify for Indigenous business benefits, Indigenous people must own/control more than half (51%+) of the company. This prevents "Black Cladding" by ensuring genuine Indigenous ownership.*
<!--SR:!2025-10-13,3,267-->

What does Supply Nation certification provide?;;Indigenous business directory listing and verification that helps government agencies identify legitimate Indigenous suppliers.
*In simple terms: It's like a verified badge for Indigenous businesses. Government agencies can search the Supply Nation directory to find legitimate Indigenous companies, and certification proves you're the real deal.*
<!--SR:!2025-10-12,2,246-->

## Frameworks & Standards

What does IRAP stand for and what is it?;;Information Security Registered Assessors Program - Australian government security assessment framework requiring certified assessors to evaluate systems handling government data.
*In simple terms: It's the official certification for security professionals who can audit government systems. If you handle government data, you need an IRAP-certified person to check your security is good enough. Think of it like a health inspector but for cybersecurity.*
<!--SR:!2025-10-11,1,230-->

What are the Essential Eight maturity levels?;;Maturity Level 1 (basic), Level 2 (managed), Level 3 (robust) - progressive cybersecurity controls defined by Australian Cyber Security Centre.
*In simple terms: Three levels of cybersecurity protection. Level 1 is like locking your doors, Level 2 is adding an alarm system, Level 3 is a full security setup with cameras and guards. Government agencies require different levels depending on data sensitivity.*

What are the 8 strategies in the Essential Eight?;;Application control, patching applications, patching operating systems, multi-factor authentication, restricting administrative privileges, logging, regular backups, and Microsoft Office macro settings.
*In simple terms: The 8 must-do cybersecurity practices. Only allow approved apps, keep software updated, use 2FA, limit admin access, track what happens, backup data, and block risky Office macros. These stop ~85% of cyber attacks.*

What is ISO 27001?;;International standard for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) providing framework for protecting organizational data.
*In simple terms: Internationally recognized certification that proves you have proper security systems in place. Like getting a quality seal for how you protect data. Government and big companies often require it.*
<!--SR:!2025-10-12,2,246-->

What is the Commonwealth Procurement Rules (CPR)?;;Framework governing how Australian government agencies must conduct procurement activities.
*In simple terms: The rulebook for how government agencies must buy things. It includes the Indigenous procurement preferences (IPP) and ensures fair, transparent purchasing processes.*

What is DISP?;;Defence Industry Security Program - security clearance framework required to handle classified Defence work.
*In simple terms: The security clearance you need to work on Defence projects with classified information. Like a background check on steroids - they verify you can be trusted with military/defence secrets.*

What does CREST stand for?;;Council of Registered Ethical Security Testers - international accreditation for penetration testing methodologies.
*In simple terms: International certification for penetration testers (ethical hackers). Shows you follow proper testing methods and ethics when trying to break into systems. Like a license for professional hackers.*

## Competitors & Market

Who are Mokai's main Indigenous cybersecurity competitors?;;Baidam Solutions, Willyama Services, Arrpwere - all Supply Nation certified with government client bases.
*In simple terms: The three biggest Indigenous cybersecurity companies you're competing against. They've all got government clients and proper Indigenous certifications. These are the companies agencies compare you to.*

What is Baidam Solutions' unique differentiator?;;Australia's first Indigenous-run Security Operations Centre (SOC) launched in 2023, with Google partnership and 50%+ profit reinvestment to Indigenous training.
*In simple terms: They run Australia's first Indigenous cybersecurity monitoring center (SOC), partnered with Google, and give half their profits back to train Indigenous people in tech. Strong social impact story.*

When was Willyama Services founded and what is its scale?;;Founded 2016, grew to 50+ staff by 2022 with offices in Canberra, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, securing largest Defence cyber security contract.
*In simple terms: Started in 2016, within 6 years they grew to 50+ employees across 4 major cities and won the biggest Defence cybersecurity contract ever given to an Indigenous company. This shows rapid, successful growth is possible.*

What revenue did Willyama Services achieve?;;Estimated $5-6M annual revenue by 2021, growing from startup in 2016 to multi-million by year 5.
*In simple terms: In just 5 years they went from $0 to $5-6 million annual revenue. This is the growth trajectory to benchmark against - shows what's achievable with the right execution.*

What is Arrpwere's business model?;;Founded ~2018, operates three divisions: Consulting, People (staff augmentation), and Cyber (products/services) serving Defence and federal agencies.

What is Baidam's "Bridging the Gap" initiative?;;Program that reinvests over 50% of profits into Indigenous community training, scholarships, and STEM education.

What percentage of Baidam's work is government vs private?;;Approximately 80%+ government contracts in early years, with private sector as secondary focus.

## Business Model & Operations

What are the three main service delivery models for cyber consulting?;;1. Staff augmentation (contractor placement), 2. Project-based delivery (fixed scope), 3. Managed services (ongoing retainer).
*In simple terms: Three ways to make money in cyber: 1) Rent out contractors (like Uber for cybersecurity pros), 2) Fixed-price projects (like building a house), 3) Ongoing monthly service (like a gym membership). Mokai uses model #1 primarily.*

What is a realistic gross margin for contractor-based consulting?;;50-100% markup on contractor cost, typically resulting in 30-40% net profit after overhead.
*In simple terms: If you pay a contractor $800/day, you bill the client $1,200-$1,600/day. After paying office costs, insurance, etc., you keep $300-$400 per day profit. The contractor does the work, you manage and mark it up.*

What is a Target Operating Model (TOM)?;;Strategic blueprint defining how a business will operate, covering People, Process, Technology, Governance, and Finance to deliver value.

What does SOP stand for in business operations?;;Standard Operating Procedures - documented processes ensuring consistency and quality in service delivery.
*In simple terms: Step-by-step instructions for how to do things in your business (like onboarding contractors, delivering projects). Ensures everyone follows the same quality process every time.*
<!--SR:!2025-10-13,3,266-->

What is the Operating Model Canvas (POLISM)?;;Framework mapping operations across: Processes, Organization (People), Locations, Information, Suppliers, Management Systems.
*In simple terms: A visual way to map out how your business works across 6 areas: what you do (Processes), who does it (People), where (Locations), data/knowledge (Information), partners (Suppliers), and how you manage it all (Management).*
<!--SR:!2025-10-11,1,226-->

What is a RACI matrix?;;Tool defining who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed for each process step.

What is SIPOC?;;Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers - high-level process mapping tool for service delivery chains.

What is service productization?;;Turning ad-hoc consulting into standardized, repeatable offerings with defined scope, deliverables, and pricing.

What are typical vCISO service tiers?;;Basic (monthly reports + calls), Standard (+ quarterly workshops + incident guidance), Comprehensive (weekly engagements + policy development).

## Success Patterns & Validation

What is a realistic revenue timeline for Indigenous professional services?;;Year 1: $100-300K, Year 2: $500K (ambitious but achievable), Year 3+: $1M+ with proper execution.

What are the key founder credentials for success?;;Strong industry experience, government networks, technical certifications (IRAP, security clearances), and business acumen.

What percentage of Indigenous businesses typically rely on government work initially?;;80%+ of revenue in early years, using IPP preferences and government panels.
*In simple terms: Most successful Indigenous businesses get 80%+ of their money from government in the first few years. Makes sense - government has mandatory Indigenous targets and bigger budgets. Build foundation there, then expand to private sector.*
<!--SR:!2025-10-12,2,247-->

What is the contractor-to-employee transition strategy?;;Start with contractors to validate demand, convert critical contractors to employees once sustained work justifies fixed costs.

What is the typical margin on contractor services?;;Aim for 50-100% gross margin on contractors, resulting in 30-40% net profit after overhead and non-billable time.

  Example 1: 100% Gross Margin
  - You pay contractor: $800/day
  - You bill client: $1,600/day ($800 × 2)
  - Gross margin: $800 ($1,600 - $800 = $800)
  - Gross margin %: 50% ($800 ÷ $1,600)

  Example 2: 50% Gross Margin
  - You pay contractor: $800/day
  - You bill client: $1,200/day ($800 × 1.5)
  - Gross margin: $400 ($1,200 - $800 = $400)
  - Gross margin %: 33% ($400 ÷ $1,200)

## Critical Success Factors

What are the 4 critical areas for Mokai business model validation?;;1. Competitive intelligence, 2. Business model validation, 3. Founder alignment, 4. Market opportunity sizing.

What is the #1 strategic research priority?;;Competitive intelligence - understanding who you're actually competing against and how to win.

What are the founder dependency risks?;;Jack's contractor network and technical credibility, Harry's IPP expertise, Kelly's lead generation capability.
*In simple terms: The business relies heavily on 3 people's unique skills: Jack knows all the contractors and has tech credibility, Harry knows Indigenous procurement system, Kelly brings in new business. If any one leaves, Mokai loses critical capabilities.*
<!--SR:!2025-10-11,1,230-->

What happens if Jack leaves?;;The entire contractor network and technical credibility could disappear - critical single point of failure.
*In simple terms: Jack is the MOST critical person. He has all the contractor relationships and is the technical expert clients trust. If he leaves, Mokai loses its delivery capacity and technical reputation overnight. This MUST be de-risked.*
<!--SR:!2025-10-13,3,266-->

What are the three components of market sizing?;;TAM (Total Addressable Market), SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market), SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market).
*In simple terms: Three ways to measure market size: TAM = total cybersecurity spend in Australia (huge), SAM = government cybersecurity that Indigenous businesses can access (smaller), SOM = what Mokai can realistically win in next 3 years (smallest, most important).*
<!--SR:!2025-10-11,1,226-->

## Implementation & Risk Management

What are the key contractor model risks?;;Quality inconsistency, IP ownership issues, compliance gaps, dependency on individuals, availability problems.

How to mitigate contractor quality issues?;;Rigorous vetting, standardized methodologies, peer review processes, clear documentation, strong contracts.

What is the recommended markup for contractor services?;;Bill clients roughly double what you pay the contractor (e.g., $800/day cost → $1600/day billing).
*In simple terms: 2x markup is the sweet spot. Pay contractor $800, charge client $1,600. This covers your costs (insurance, management time, overhead) and leaves healthy profit. Industry standard.*
<!--SR:!2025-10-11,1,227-->

What is the contractor onboarding process?;;1. Verify credentials, 2. Sign agreements (NDA, IP), 3. Account setup, 4. Orientation on methodology, 5. Assign mentor.
*In simple terms: Before a contractor starts work: check they're qualified, get legal docs signed (NDAs, IP ownership), give them access to systems, teach them your way of doing things, pair them with someone experienced. Like orientation for a new employee.*
<!--SR:!2025-10-11,1,226-->

What are the quality assurance best practices?;;Peer review process, standardized templates, client communication protocols, feedback loops, post-project debriefs.

What is the recommended cash flow buffer?;;Working capital for contractor payments, product purchases, and 3-6 months operating expenses before cash-flow positive.
