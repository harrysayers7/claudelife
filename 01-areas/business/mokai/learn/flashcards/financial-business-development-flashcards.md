# Financial Operations & Business Development - Flashcards

What is the key cash flow challenge with contractor payments and how to mitigate it?
?
Challenge: Often must pay contractors in 14 days but clients pay in 30+ days. Mitigation: 1) Negotiate "pay-when-paid" with contractors, 2) Align contractor terms to Net 30, 3) Maintain cash buffer for one payment cycle, 4) Use milestone billing on longer projects.
<br><br><span style="color: #3b82f6;">**Simple Explanation:**</span> Like fronting money for a group pizza order - you pay the restaurant now but friends pay you back later. Solutions: Ask friends to pay you when they get their allowance, keep spare cash for covering it, or collect money in stages (half now, half later).
<br><br><span style="color: #10b981;">**Key Terms:**</span>
- **Cash flow**: Timing of money coming in vs. going out
- **Net 30**: Payment due 30 days after invoice date
- **Pay-when-paid**: Contractor gets paid only after you receive payment from client
- **Milestone billing**: Invoicing at project stages, not just at the end
