# Mokai Operations Guide - Flashcards

## Indigenous Business & Procurement

What is Supply Nation certification and why is it critical for Mokai?
?
Supply Nation certification verifies at least 51% Aboriginal ownership and Indigenous management control. It's mandatory for accessing Indigenous Procurement Policy (IPP) benefits like direct procurement and set-aside contracts.
<br><br><span style="color: #3b82f6;">**Simple Explanation:**</span> It's like an official badge proving your business is genuinely Aboriginal-owned and run by Aboriginal people - without it, you can't access special government contract opportunities reserved for Indigenous businesses.
<br><br><span style="color: #10b981;">**Key Terms:**</span>
- **Certification**: Official approval/verification by an authority
- **Indigenous ownership**: Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people owning majority of the business
- **Management control**: Indigenous people actually running the business (not just on paper)
<br><br><span style="color: #f59e0b;">**Abbreviations:**</span>
- **IPP**: Indigenous Procurement Policy - Government rule requiring agencies to buy from Indigenous businesses first


What is the Mandatory Set-Aside (MSA) range under IPP?
?
Contracts between $80,000 and $200,000 (or any amount for remote area work) must first be offered to Indigenous businesses before opening to others.
<br><br><span style="color: #3b82f6;">**Simple Explanation:**</span> Think of it like a "first dibs" rule - for contracts in this price range, the government MUST ask Indigenous businesses first before anyone else gets a chance to bid.
<br><br><span style="color: #10b981;">**Key Terms:**</span>
- **Set-Aside**: Reserving opportunities for specific groups
- **Remote area work**: Projects in distant/regional locations
<br><br><span style="color: #f59e0b;">**Abbreviations:**</span>
- **MSA**: Mandatory Set-Aside - Required reservation of contracts for Indigenous suppliers


What is Exemption 16 and how does it benefit Mokai?
?
Exemption 16 allows government departments to directly award contracts of ANY size to Indigenous SMEs without competitive tender, as long as they demonstrate value for money.
<br><br><span style="color: #3b82f6;">**Simple Explanation:**</span> It's like a fast-track pass - instead of competing in a big tender against everyone, the government can choose to give you the contract directly if they think you offer good value.
<br><br><span style="color: #10b981;">**Key Terms:**</span>
- **Direct award**: Giving a contract to one supplier without competition
- **Competitive tender**: Open bidding process where multiple companies compete
- **Value for money**: Getting good quality service at a fair price
<br><br><span style="color: #f59e0b;">**Abbreviations:**</span>
- **SME**: Small-Medium Enterprise - Businesses with fewer than 200 employees


How often does Supply Nation audit Indigenous businesses?
?
Annual audits and real-time checks when ownership changes occur. ASIC updates trigger automatic reviews to ensure continued 51%+ Indigenous ownership.
<br><br><span style="color: #3b82f6;">**Simple Explanation:**</span> They check every year to make sure you're still genuinely Aboriginal-owned, and if you change owners or sell shares, they check immediately - like a referee watching to ensure fair play.
<br><br><span style="color: #10b981;">**Key Terms:**</span>
- **Audit**: Official inspection of records to verify compliance
- **Real-time checks**: Immediate verification when changes happen

<br><br><span style="color: #3b82f6;">**Simple Explanation:**</span> It's like checking a babysitter's resume, calling their previous families, and doing a police check - you verify skills, past performance, and trustworthiness before hiring them.

<br><br><span style="color: #3b82f6;">**Simple Explanation:**</span> Like the center of a wheel with spokes going out - you're the hub connecting everything, so all important messages go through you to keep everyone coordinated (instead of people talking directly and creating confusion).

<br><br><span style="color: #3b82f6;">**Simple Explanation:**</span> Like having backup plans at school - finish homework early in case you need to redo it, have a study buddy who can help if your main partner is sick, and be a good friend so people want to help you when needed.
