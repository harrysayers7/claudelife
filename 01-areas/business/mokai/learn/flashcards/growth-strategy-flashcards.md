# Growth Strategy - Flashcards

When should Mokai hire full-time employees vs. using contractors?
?
When a role is utilized 60-70% of time (makes financial sense), need continuity/internal IP development, want guaranteed availability, or strategic skills should stay in-house (vs. commodity/occasional work better contracted).
<br><br><span style="color: #3b82f6;">**Simple Explanation:**</span> Like deciding to buy vs. rent equipment - buy (hire full-time) when you use it most days and need it to always work perfectly; rent (contractor) when you only need it occasionally or for special projects.
<br><br><span style="color: #10b981;">**Key Terms:**</span>
- **Utilization rate**: Percentage of time a role has billable work
- **Internal IP**: Knowledge and tools developed inside company
- **Guaranteed availability**: Certainty someone will prioritize your work
- **Commodity work**: Common tasks easily outsourced
<br><br><span style="color: #f59e0b;">**Abbreviations:**</span>
- **IP**: Intellectual Property - Owned knowledge, tools, methods

What is the recommended client diversification strategy?
?
Mix government projects (for revenue spikes and credibility) with enterprise clients (for stable recurring income). Target industries with strong Indigenous engagement: mining, banking, infrastructure (ESG/RAP commitments).
<br><br><span style="color: #3b82f6;">**Simple Explanation:**</span> Like having different income streams in college - government contracts are like scholarship windfalls (big but irregular), corporate clients are like part-time jobs (steady smaller amounts). Focus on companies that actively want to support Indigenous students.
<br><br><span style="color: #10b981;">**Key Terms:**</span>
- **Revenue spikes**: Large irregular income increases
- **Recurring income**: Regular predictable revenue
- **Client diversification**: Not depending on one customer type
- **ESG commitments**: Corporate environmental, social, governance goals
<br><br><span style="color: #f59e0b;">**Abbreviations:**</span>
- **ESG**: Environmental, Social, Governance - Corporate responsibility framework
- **RAP**: Reconciliation Action Plan - Indigenous engagement commitment

How should service portfolio expansion be prioritized?
?
First deepen expertise in current services (become best at Essential 8/IRAP/GRC), then expand horizontally only if: 1) Aligns with core competencies, 2) Market demand validated, 3) Resources available (avoid distraction), 4) Can differentiate from competitors.
<br><br><span style="color: #3b82f6;">**Simple Explanation:**</span> Like choosing college majors - master your main subject first (be the best at what you do), then add minors only if: 1) Related to your strengths, 2) Employers want it, 3) You have time without hurting grades, 4) Sets you apart from others.
<br><br><span style="color: #10b981;">**Key Terms:**</span>
- **Service portfolio**: Range of services offered
- **Core competencies**: Main areas of expertise
- **Horizontal expansion**: Adding different but related services
- **Vertical deepening**: Becoming more expert in existing services

What growth considerations preserve Mokai's Indigenous mission?
?
1) Avoid diluting ownership below 51% (protect Supply Nation certification), 2) Bring Indigenous professionals along (hiring, training pipeline), 3) Network Indigenous cyber consultants, 4) Balance financial growth with community impact goals.
<br><br><span style="color: #3b82f6;">**Simple Explanation:**</span> Like staying true to cultural roots while succeeding - 1) Keep majority ownership in Indigenous hands (don't sell out), 2) Help other Indigenous people get into the field, 3) Build community of Indigenous tech professionals, 4) Make money but also create positive change for Indigenous people.
<br><br><span style="color: #10b981;">**Key Terms:**</span>
- **Ownership dilution**: Reducing Indigenous ownership percentage
- **Talent pipeline**: System for developing future Indigenous professionals
- **Community impact**: Positive effects on Indigenous communities
- **Mission preservation**: Maintaining core cultural/social values while growing
