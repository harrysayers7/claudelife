When they ask "What does this cost?":

**Don't say**: "$45K for the assessment"

**Do say**: "Enterprise assessments with remediation roadmaps range from $85K to $120K depending on environment complexity. For a mid-tier agency with standard infrastructure, we're typically in the $45K-$60K range. Does that align with what you've budgeted?"

Anchors high, then your real number feels like a deal. The final question forces them to reveal budget constraints.
