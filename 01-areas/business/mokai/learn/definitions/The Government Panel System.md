## **The Government "Panel" System**

Think of it like being on an approved vendor list:

- **Federal government** has a panel (list of approved sellers)
- **Currently:** 2,700 total sellers, only **66 are Indigenous businesses**
- **Types of panels:**
    - Professional services (consultants, experts)
    - Software
    - Hardware

**Why it matters:**

- If you're ON the panel → government can buy from you easily
- If you're NOT on the panel → much harder to sell to government
- Jack says the panels are currently **closed** but will reopen (they're redoing them to focus on "value for money")
