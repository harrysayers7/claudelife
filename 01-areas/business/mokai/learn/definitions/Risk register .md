title: "Risk register "
---
A cybersecurity risk register is a living document that acts as an organization's master inventory of all potential digital threats, logging key details for eachâ€”like the nature of the threat, its potential impact, and its likelihood of occurring.
By centralizing this information, the register allows the company to calculate a risk score, prioritize its security efforts, assign an owner to manage each problem, and track the progress of mitigation plans to ensure critical systems and data are protected.
