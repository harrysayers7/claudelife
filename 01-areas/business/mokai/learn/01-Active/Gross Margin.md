# Full Example
**Scenario:** 10-day project, 100% gross margin

---

### Revenue Side

- Client pays: $1,600/day × 10 days = **$16,000**

### Contractor Cost

- Contractor paid: $800/day × 10 days = **$8,000**
- Gross margin: **$8,000** (50%)
### Your Overhead

- Non-billable contractor time: $800 × 1 day = **$800**
- Sales time (20 hours @ $100/hr): **$2,000**
- Project management (10 hours @ $100/hr): **$1,000**
- Insurance/admin/tools: **$500**
- **Total overhead:** $4,300
### Net Profit

- $8,000 gross - $4,300 overhead = **$3,700** (23% net)
> **Note:** Even with 100% markup, net profit only hits 23% due to overhead.

## Why Industry Says 30-40% Net
To hit 30-40% net profit, you need to:
1. Bill contractors at 2× rate (100% markup)
2. Keep overhead lean (15-20% of revenue; not 27% like above)
3. Maximize billable hours (get contractors to 80-90% utilization)
4. Reduce sales costs (win repeat business, not every job from scratch)
---

# Optimized Example
**Same project, but more efficient:**

- Revenue: **$16,000**
- Contractor cost: **$8,000** (all billable)
- Gross margin: **$8,000**
- Overhead (leaner): **$2,500** (15.6%)
- Net profit: **$5,500** (34%)
---

## Key Takeaway
**The Formula:**
- Bill Rate = Contractor Cost × 2
- Gross Margin = 50% of revenue
- Net Profit = 30–40% of revenue (if you run lean)
**What "running lean" means:**
- Minimal non-billable contractor time
- Efficient sales process (productized services help)
- Low fixed overhead (cloud tools, no office)
- High contractor utilization (always have projects lined up)
>This is why research emphasizes that contractor models are only profitable with strong processes—sloppy overhead management quickly turns a 50% gross margin into 10–15% net profit.
