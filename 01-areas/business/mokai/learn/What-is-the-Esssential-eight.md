## Summary

**The Essential Eight (ACSC)**

The Essential Eight are baseline mitigation strategies recommended by the Australian Cyber Security Centre to reduce the risk of cyber incidents. They focus on limiting initial access, execution, privilege escalation, persistence, and data exfiltration. Organisations are encouraged to implement these controls to at least the “Maturity Level” appropriate to their risk profile.

### **1. Application control**

- Allow only approved applications to run (whitelisting), using methods like hash, publisher or path rules.

### **2. Patch applications**

- Apply security patches for internet-facing and commonly exploited applications promptly (e.g., web browsers, Office, Adobe).

**3. Configure Microsoft Office macro settings**

- Block macros from the internet, only allow vetted macros, use application control to enforce policies.

**4. User application hardening**

- Disable risky functionality (e.g., Flash, ads, unnecessary extensions); block web content via browser settings; reduce attack surface.

**5. Restrict administrative privileges**

- Limit admin accounts; use separate accounts for admin tasks; implement just-in-time and just-enough administration where possible.

**6. Patch operating systems**

- Keep OS security patches up to date, prioritise internet-facing and high-risk systems.

**7. Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**

- Enforce MFA for remote access, privileged users, and sensitive services (VPN, email, admin portals).

**8. Daily backup of important data**

- Maintain regular, tested backups isolated from the network, with retention and integrity protections.
