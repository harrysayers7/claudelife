## 📝 Practical Example - Your Journey

**Today (Day 1):**

- `00-Plans/leadership-confidence-plan.md` ← The plan we're making
- `01-Active/strategic-fluency/z-mokai-positioning.md` ← Your first Zettel
- `04-Resources/mokai-roles-reference.md` ← Copy of Harry/Jack roles

**Day 3 (First Review):**

- `02-Review/review-2025-10-12.md` ← Log saying you reviewed positioning
- Re-read `z-mokai-positioning.md` without looking first

**Week 8 (Mastered):**

- Move `z-mokai-positioning.md` from `01-Active/` to `03-Mastered/`
- Because you can explain it confidently without notes

## 🎯 Key Principle: Active vs Archive

**Active (01)** = Working memory, currently practicing
**Mastered (03)** = Long-term memory, automatic
**Resources (04)** = External memory, reference only

**You want to move things from 01 → 03 as fast as possible through spaced repetition!**
