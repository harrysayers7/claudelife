## 🧠 Strategic Context (for AI)

**Harry's Real Burning Need**:
"Learn to talk the talk and be a credible CEO. Understand the business side (Operations Guide). Build solid foundation for execution."

**What Actually Moves MOKAI Forward Right Now**:
1. Harry learning Operations Guide (while waiting on legal)
2. Legal docs ready to sign the moment Jack's trust is done
3. Jack's network primed for activation post-registration

**Decision Framework**:
- Does this help Harry become a competent business operator? → Do it
- Does this prepare for fast execution once registered? → Do it
- Is this premature (requires legal entity)? → Note for Phase 2
