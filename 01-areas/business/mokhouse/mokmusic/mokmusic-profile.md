## Business Identity

- **Function:** Music composition, sonic branding, and sound production
- **Ownership & Control:** Same as parent company (Harry Sayers sole shareholder, Kell Mendoza director)

---

---

## Target Market

- **Government contracts:** Cultural projects, campaign work
- **Corporate clients:** Advertising agencies, brands with national campaigns
- **Entertainment/Media:** TV, film, streaming, and online content
- **IP value:** Music works generate both upfront fees and long-tail royalties/licensing
- **Working with ESM:** Switching from my Sole trader ABN to now operating under mok house

---

## Financial Context

- **Project pricing:** Typically $5,000–$30,000+ per engagement, depending on scope, licensing, and exclusivity
- **Licensing models:**
  - Buy-out (flat fee, most common for ads)
  - Term/territory licensing (recurring revenue if extended)
  - Publishing/royalties (APRA AMCOS collection for broadcast and streaming)
- **Delivery model:** Upfront project deposit (30–50%), balance on completion, with licensing clauses as required

---

## Tax & Accounting Considerations

- **GST:** Required on invoices for Australian clients
- **Royalties:** Collected through APRA AMCOS and other PROs → treated as assessable income
- **International income:** Possible withholding taxes from foreign licensees (e.g., U.S., EU). May need Double Tax Agreement review
- **Contractors:** Regular payments to session musicians, engineers, or voice-over artists → confirm contractor vs PAYG obligations
- **Asset management:** Music masters, stems, and IP rights are intangible assets. Important for valuation and licensing negotiations

---

## Funding & Grants

- Eligible for Indigenous arts and cultural grants, plus commercial opportunities via Indigenous Procurement Policy (IPP)
- Potential access to Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) if licensing or placements expand internationally

---

## Key Risks to Flag

- **Cash flow variability:** Project-based income is less predictable than retainers
- **IP protection:** Contracts must specify ownership (MOK retains publishing vs client buy-out)
- **Foreign income:** Extra compliance if expanding licensing offshore
- **Royalty collection:** Requires ongoing APRA AMCOS management and accurate reporting of works

---

## Summary

MOK Music is the music and sound division of MOK HOUSE Pty Ltd, delivering high-value composition and sonic branding projects. It generates upfront cash from project fees and long-term royalty streams from licensing. For accountants, the key focus areas are GST compliance, contractor payments, royalty income treatment, and IP asset management.
