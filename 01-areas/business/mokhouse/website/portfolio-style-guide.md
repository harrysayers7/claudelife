# MOK HOUSE Portfolio Writing Style Guide

**Purpose**: This style guide teaches the `/mokhouse-portfolio-blurb` command how to write in your preferred style. It learns from past blurbs and your selections over time.

---

## Tone Preferences

### Lead Strategy
- ✅ **Always start with partnership context**: "Harry partnered with [Client]..."
- ✅ **Name the client and challenge first** before diving into creative details
- ❌ **Don't lead with technical details** or equipment/process
- ✅ **Use "Harry" not full name**: Keep it personal and approachable

### Sentence Structure
- ✅ **Preferred**: Short, punchy impact statements
- ✅ **Mix sentence lengths**: Combine short and medium sentences for rhythm
- ❌ **Avoid**: Long flowing sentences with multiple clauses that lose energy

### Voice and Perspective
- ✅ **Third person always**: "Harry developed..." not "I developed..."
- ✅ **Focus on impact**: What the work achieved for the client
- ✅ **Confident but grounded**: State accomplishments without overselling

---

## Word Choice

### Preferred Terms
- "crafted" over "created" (implies artistry)
- "sonic branding" over "music production" (for brand work)
- "partnered with" over "worked for" (implies collaboration)
- "developed" over "made" (implies thoughtful process)
- "amplified" for impact/enhancement language
- "fused" or "layered" for combining elements

### Avoid
- ❌ Marketing jargon ("synergy", "elevate brand presence")
- ❌ Overly technical music terms (unless essential to story)
- ❌ Superlatives without backing ("revolutionary", "groundbreaking")
- ❌ Passive voice ("was created by", "was developed by")
- ❌ Clichés ("bringing ideas to life", "took it to the next level")

---

## Tagline Patterns

### What Works
- **Format**: `[Project Name] — [Verb-driven impact statement]`
- **Example**: "Repco 100 Years — Fueling Repco's centenary with sound"
- **Length**: Under 12 words
- **Tone**: Confident, action-oriented, client-benefit focused
- **Pattern**: Uses strong verbs that connect to client's industry/mission

### What Doesn't Work
- ❌ Generic phrases: "Bringing ideas to life"
- ❌ Self-focused: "Harry's latest work" (focus on client impact)
- ❌ Overly clever wordplay that obscures meaning
- ❌ Descriptive instead of action-oriented

### Tagline Formula
```
[Client Project] — [Strong Verb]ing [Client's Core Mission/Value] with [medium/approach]
```

**Examples that follow the pattern:**
- "Repco 100 Years — Fueling Repco's centenary with sound"
- "Nike Run Club — Driving athletic ambition through rhythm"
- "Toyota Launch — Powering innovation with cinematic score"

---

## Description Structure

### Ideal Flow (4-Part Structure)

**1. Partnership Setup (1 sentence)**
- Introduce Harry + Client + Project type
- Example: "Harry partnered with Repco to craft the sonic branding for their 100-year campaign."

**2. Creative Challenge (1 sentence)**
- State the brief or creative problem
- Example: "The brief called for music reflecting Repco's heritage while capturing modern motorsport energy."

**3. Harry's Approach (1-2 sentences)**
- Specific creative/sonic choices made
- Why those choices served the brief
- Example: "Harry developed a driving score fusing gritty guitar with cinematic layers, amplifying the campaign's momentum."

**4. Impact (optional if word count allows)**
- End with the result or impact on the campaign
- Example: "The soundtrack ensured the audio hit as hard as the imagery."

### Length Guidelines
- **STRICT MAXIMUM**: 50 words
- **Target**: 45-50 words (optimal impact)
- **Minimum**: 40 words (ensure key points covered)

### Pacing
- Start strong with partnership
- Build through creative challenge
- Peak with specific sonic choices
- Land with impact statement

## Examples of Ideal Blurbs

### Example 1: Repco 100 Years (Gold Standard)

**Tagline**: "Repco 100 Years — Fueling Repco's centenary with sound."

**Project Information** (45 words):
Harry partnered with Repco to craft the sonic branding for their 100-year campaign. The brief called for music reflecting Repco's heritage while capturing modern motorsport energy. Harry developed a driving score fusing gritty guitar with cinematic layers, amplifying the campaign's momentum.

**Appreciation**:
Audio Producer / Composer — Harry Sayers
Client — Repco
Agency / Production — Electric Sheep Music

**Why it works:**
- ✅ Clear partnership intro establishes context immediately
- ✅ Brief describes both heritage (past) and modernity (future) tension
- ✅ Specific sonic choices mentioned (gritty guitar, cinematic layers)
- ✅ Connects sonic choices to impact (amplifying momentum)
- ✅ Word count: 45 words (perfect 50-word limit)
- ✅ Uses "Harry" instead of full name (personal, approachable)
- ✅ Tagline uses industry-relevant verb ("Fueling" for automotive brand)
