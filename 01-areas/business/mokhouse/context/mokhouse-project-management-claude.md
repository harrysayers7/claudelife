---

## Phase 1: Project Creation from Brief

### Step 1: Identify Brief Email

**Use:** `search_gmail_messages` or `read_gmail_thread`

**Look for:**

- Emails from Electric Sheep Music (esmusic@dext.cc)
- Subject lines containing "brief", "project", or client names
- Google Docs links in email body
- Project deadlines or requirements
- additional notes from Glenn or Kate about the brief that aren't included in  Google doc breif


### Step 2: Extract Google Doc Link

**From the email, extract:**

- Google Docs URL (https://docs.google.com/document/d/...)
- Any contextual information from the email
- Sender details and urgency indicators
-

### Step 3: Fetch Brief Content

**Use:** `google_drive_fetch` with document ID from URL

**Extract these details:**

- Project name/campaign name
- Client/brand name
- Brief description/summary
- Target audience
- Platform (TV, digital, social media)
- Duration requirements
- Due date
- Budget/fee information
- Creative direction
- Reference materials
- Any special requirements

### Step 4: Create Obsidian Project File

**Use:** `mcp-obsidian:obsidian_put_content`

**File naming:** `[YYMMDD]-[project-name-slug].md`
**Location:** `/Users/harrysayers/Developer/claudelife/02-projects/mokhouse/[filename].md`

**Populate markdown template with:**

```yaml
---
relation:
  - "[[mokhouse]]"
  - "[[mokhouse-projects]]"
project name: "[Extracted project name]"
customer: "[Client name - default: Electric Sheep Music]"
status: "Brief Received"
demo fee: [Amount or leave blank]
award fee: [Amount or leave blank]
due date: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
date received: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
internal review: ""
Date Paid: ""
PO: ""
"Invoice #": ""
submitted date: ""
paid: false
awarded: false
APRA: false
12 FOS: [true/false - based on brief requirements]
---
```

### Step 5: Fill Brief Summary Section with Improved Formatting

**Use this structure with proper spacing and callouts:**

````markdown
> [!NOTE]
> ## Details:
>
> **JOB NUMBER:** [number]
> **AGENCY:** [agency]
> **CLIENT:** [client]
> **PRODUCT:** [product]
> **LENGTH:** [duration]

> [!DELIVERABLES]
>
> - [List all deliverables from brief]
> - [Each on separate line]

> [!TRACK LENGTH]
>
> [Track length requirements and details]

```YYMMDD_[JobNumber]_[Client]_3A_Mus.wav```

---

## [Project Name] Brief

**CREATIVE DIRECTION:**

[Brief content with proper line breaks and spacing]


**TONE & EMOTION:**

[Content with proper spacing between paragraphs]


**INSTRUMENTATION:**

[Content with proper spacing between paragraphs]


**STRUCTURE:**

[Content with proper spacing between paragraphs]


**CLIENT FEEDBACK:**

[Content with proper spacing between paragraphs]

---
````

### Step 6: Generate AI Suggestions with Improved Format

**Use the embedded prompt in the markdown file:**

Execute this prompt with the brief information:

> Act as a world-class composer, vocalist, and sonic branding strategist for memorable, emotional, and brand-driven jingles and sonic identities across TV, digital, and social media.
>
> Given the creative brief above (brand, audience, platform, messaging, tone, duration, and key campaign goals), generate:
>
> - Catchy, emotionally resonant jingle lyrics and concepts (≤30s) tailored to platform and audience
> - Melody style & feel (describe musical genre, tempo, instrumentation, and overall mood)
> - Sound design/production ideas (instruments, FX, mnemonic motifs, and transitions)
> - A short, reusable sonic logo/audio mnemonic if appropriate
> - Concise creative intent paragraph connecting concept to the brand's goals

**Format as:**

```markdown
## AI Suggestions

> [!NOTE]
> **Creative Concept:**
>
> [Generated creative direction with proper spacing]
>
>
> **Musical Direction:**
>
> - **Genre:** [genre]
> - **Tempo:** [tempo with reasoning]
> - **Key Elements:** [elements]
>
>
> **Sound Design Ideas:**
>
> - Opening: [description]
> - Drop: [description]
> - Texture: [description]
> - [Special moments]: [description]
>
>
> **Sonic Logo/Audio Mnemonic:**
>
> [Description of memorable audio element]
>
>
> **Creative Intent:**
>
> [Paragraph connecting concept to brand goals]
```

### Step 7: Generate SUNO Prompt (1000 Characters Max)

**Use the embedded SUNO prompt template:**

Execute this prompt:

> You are a music prompt assistant. Given a jingle project brief, generate a detailed SUNO AI prompt using the following format - ensure the output is less than 1000 characters:
>
> [Title: {Project or Track Name}] [Genre: {Main genre or hybrid style}] [Mood: {3–5 emotional descriptors}] [Instruments: {Primary + supporting instruments}] [Structure: {Overall flow, e.g. Intro → Build → Climax → Outro}] [Tempo: {Approx BPM or feel: slow, mid-tempo, fast}]

**Format as code block:**

```markdown
## SUNO prompt

```

[Title: Project Name] [Genre: Style] [Mood: 3-5 descriptors] [Instruments: List] [Structure: Flow] [Tempo: BPM/feel]

[Intro 00:00-00:XX] Description [Build 00:XX-00:XX] Description
[Drop 00:XX-00:XX] Description [Main 00:XX-00:XX] Description [Outro 00:XX-end] Description

Requirements: [Key requirements]

**Critical:** Maximum 1000 characters total (not words)

### Step 8: Complete File Structure

```markdown
---

## Creative References

- **Reference Tracks:** [tracks]

- **Client Notes:** [notes]

- **Mood/Style:** [style notes]

---

> [!NOTE]
> ## Other relevant info:
>
> **Original Reference:** [if replacing existing track]
>
> **Key Challenge:** [main creative challenge]
>
> **Sync Points:** [timing requirements]
>
> **Special Moments:** [specific requirements]

## Links & Files

- **Ref Folder:** /references/[project-name]/

- **Google Doc:** [original brief URL]

- **Obsidian Links:** [[mokhouse-projects]]

- **Video Links:**
	- [link] <if required>
```

### Step 9: Confirm Project Creation

**Provide summary:**

```
✅ Project Created from Brief
────────────────────────────
Project: [project name]
Client: [customer]
Due Date: [due date]
Brief Source: [Google Doc URL]
File Created: [filename].md
Location: /Users/harrysayers/Developer/claudelife/02-projects/mokhouse/
Status: Brief Received

AI Suggestions: ✓ Generated
SUNO Prompt: ✓ Generated (1000 char limit)
Next: Create demo, then mark as submitted
────────────────────────────
```

---

## Phase 2: Project Submission Tracking

### When Demo is Completed and Submitted:

**Use:** `mcp-obsidian:obsidian_patch_content` to update:

- Status: "Submitted"
- submitted date: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
- wav name: "[Actual filename if different]"

**Command example:** "Mark [project name] as submitted"

---

## Phase 3: PO Receipt & Invoice Creation

### When PO is Received:

**Use:** `mcp-obsidian:obsidian_patch_content` to update:

- Status: "PO Received"
- PO: "[PO number without prefix]"

**Then trigger existing invoice workflow:**

### Step 1: Check Supabase for Duplicates

Before creating invoice, query Supabase `invoices` table:

```json
{
  "purchase_order_number": "[PO number without 'PO-']",
  "contact_id": "cadaf83f-9fee-4891-8bb3-5dbc14433a99"
}
```

- If duplicate found → warn me with invoice details.
- If none → proceed.

### Step 2: Confirm Invoice Details

Before Stripe creation, show summary:

```
Invoice Details
────────────────────────────
Project: [project name]
PO Number: PO-[####]
Amount (excl GST): $[amount] AUD
Product: Demo Fee: [project] PO-[####]
Due: [today + 14 days]

Issued By: MOK HOUSE PTY LTD
Customer: Electric Sheep Music PTY LTD
Email: esmusic@dext.cc

Integrations: Stripe ✓ | Obsidian ✓ | Supabase ✓
Template: ESM Invoice Template
────────────────────────────
```

Wait for explicit approval.

### Step 3: Create Invoice in Stripe

**Order (stop if any step fails):**

1. Verify customer exists (`list_customers`) → create if missing.
2. Create product (`create_product`).
3. Create price (`create_price`) → amount × 100 (cents).
4. Create draft invoice (`create_invoice`).
5. Add line item (`create_invoice_item`).
6. Finalize invoice (`finalize_invoice`) → get invoice number + URL.

### Step 4: Record Invoice in Supabase

Immediately record in `invoices` table.

**Fixed values:**

- entity_id: `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440002` (MOK HOUSE PTY LTD)
- contact_id: `cadaf83f-9fee-4891-8bb3-5dbc14433a99` (ESM)
- invoice_type: `receivable`
- currency: `AUD`
- gst_amount: 0.0 (no GST charged to this customer)
- paid_amount: 0.0

**Extracted values:**

- invoice_number (from Stripe)
- subtotal/total amount
- PO number (without prefix)
- description: "Demo Fee: [project]"
- project name
- status: _sent_ or _draft_

### Step 5: Update Obsidian Project

**Use:** `mcp-obsidian:obsidian_patch_content` to update:

- Status: "Invoiced"
- "Invoice #": "[Invoice number from Stripe]"

### Step 6: Provide Complete Success Report

Final summary includes:

- Project details
- Stripe invoice details (number, hosted link, dashboard link)
- Supabase record confirmation
- Obsidian project updated

If any system failed → report clearly, offer retry.

---

## Phase 4: Payment & Completion Tracking

### When Payment Received:

**Use:** `mcp-obsidian:obsidian_patch_content` to update:

- paid: true
- Date Paid: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
- Status: "Complete"

### When Award Decision Made:

**Use:** `mcp-obsidian:obsidian_patch_content` to update:

- awarded: true/false
- award fee: "[Amount if awarded]"
- APRA: true/false (if applicable)

---

## Key Formatting Rules

### ✅ Use These Formatting Elements:

- **Callouts:** `> [!NOTE]` for important information
- **Code blocks:** For file names and SUNO prompts
- **H2 headings:** `##` (not H3 `###`)
- **Line breaks:** Double spacing between paragraphs
- **Bold text:** For emphasis on key terms

### ✅ YAML Frontmatter Requirements:

- **Dates only:** YYYY-MM-DD format
- **Boolean values:** true/false (not quoted)
- **Numbers:** Unquoted (500 not "500")
- **12 FOS:** Boolean based on brief requirements
- **Composer number:** Always use "3" for Harrison

### ✅ File Naming Convention:

**Extract from brief:** `YYMMDD_[JobNumber]_[Client]_3A_Mus.wav`
**Harrison's number:** Always use "3"
**Format:** Code block with backticks

### ✅ SUNO Prompt Specifications:

- **Maximum:** 1000 characters (not words)
- **Format:** Code block (not callout)
- **Structure:** Title, Genre, Mood, Instruments, Structure, Tempo, timing breakdown, requirements

---

## Error Handling & Troubleshooting

**Gmail:** missing info, multiple matches, unreadable PDFs → ask me. **Google Drive:** inaccessible docs, permission issues → ask me. **Obsidian:** file creation errors, path issues → check file location. **Stripe:** stop if error, don't continue. **Supabase:** warn duplicates, log insert errors, Stripe is always source of truth. **GST confusion:** confirm explicitly if unclear.
