## How I Use APRA AMCOS

**My APRA Details:**

- Member Name: Harrison Sayers

- Member Number: 784794

- Login: harry@sayers1.com (passwordless login with security codes)

**I use APRA for two main types of work:**

### **1. Solo Commercial Music Work**

I regularly create music for advertising campaigns through clients like Electric Sheep Music. I register these tracks under my name as the sole composer. Recent examples include:

- Repco commercial (confirmed by Glenn/Kate I could register under my name)

- Nintendo campaigns

- Various automotive and brand commercials

For these projects, I always check with the production company about APRA registration, especially when they add elements like guitar parts or other musicians. As I told Glenn, "APRA is confusing AF" but I've learned to navigate it and always register my commercial work to collect performance royalties.

### **2. SAFIA Band Work**

As a member of SAFIA, I'm involved in creating band content and music. This includes:

- Writing/producing for SAFIA releases and projects

- Band material that gets registered collectively with other SAFIA members (Benjamin Woolner and Michael Bell)

**My APRA Activity:**

- I receive regular royalty payments

- I access the Writer Portal regularly using security codes

- I'm eligible for Professional Development Awards ($10,000 grants)

- I track my earnings through "Earnings Insights" in the portal

**Payment Structure:**

- My sole trader work (ABN: 89 184 087 850) is NOT GST registered, so APRA royalty statements don't include GST for my personal earnings

- SAFIA business structure is GST registered (separate from my sole trader status)

**My Registration Process:**

I always coordinate with clients about APRA registration. When there are collaborations or additional musicians involved, I check whether I should register the original version or if we need to coordinate multiple registrations. I register works under my name for compositions I create, ensuring I collect performance royalties when the music airs on TV, radio, or other platforms.

APRA provides me with ongoing passive income from both my commercial advertising work and my involvement with SAFIA, making it an essential part of my music business income streams.
