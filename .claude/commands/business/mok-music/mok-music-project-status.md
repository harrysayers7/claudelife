     database_id: "1e64a17b-b7f0-807d-b0f3-fe2cf5a6e3ac",
     page_size: 20,
     sorts: [{"property": "Submitted On", "direction": "descending"}]
   })
   ```

2. **Calculate financial summaries**

   - Current projects value (sum of "Current Projects Owed")
   - Completed projects paid (sum of "Paid Projects Total")
