# MOK Music - Client Follow-up Management

Generate follow-up communications and track outstanding items with ESM and clients.

## Usage
```
/mok-music-client-follow-up [type] [project_name]
```

**Follow-up types:**
- `overdue` - Projects over 30 days in "Invoiced" status
- `po-missing` - Projects needing purchase orders
- `apra` - Projects with incomplete APRA registrations
- `status` - General project status check
- `all` - Comprehensive follow-up report

## Steps

1. **Identify follow-up targets**
   ```javascript
   // For overdue payments
   mcp__notion__API-post-database-query({
     database_id: "1e64a17b-b7f0-807d-b0f3-fe2cf5a6e3ac",
     filter: {
       and: [
         {property: "Status", status: {equals: "Invoiced"}},
         {property: "Days", formula: {number: {greater_than: 30}}}
       ]
     }
   })
   ```

2. **Generate appropriate communication**
   Based on follow-up type:

   **Overdue Payment:**
   ```
   Subject: Follow-up: Outstanding Invoice - [Project Name]

   Hi Kate,

   Hope you're well! Just following up on the invoice for [Project Name]
   (submitted [date], currently [X] days outstanding).

   Could you please check the status with accounts? Let me know if you
   need me to resend any documentation.

   Cheers,
   Harry
   ```

   **Missing PO:**
   ```
   Subject: PO Required - [Project Name]

   Hi Kate,

   [Project Name] is ready for invoicing but I don't have a PO number yet.
   Could you please send through when convenient?

   Project details:
   â€¢ Demo Fee: $[amount]
   â€¢ Award Fee: $[amount]
   â€¢ Completion: [date]

   Thanks!
   Harry
   ```

3. **Update tracking**
   ```javascript
   mcp__notion__API-patch-page({
     page_id: "[project_id]",
     properties: {
       "Text": {
         type: "rich_text",
         rich_text: [{
           type: "text",
           text: {content: "Follow-up sent [date]: [summary]"}
         }]
       }
   })
   ```

4. **Create action items**
   - Schedule follow-up reminder (7-14 days)
   - Update project notes with communication history
   - Escalate if necessary (Glenn for creative, Kate for business)

5. **Integration with email**
   If Gmail MCP is available:
   ```javascript
   mcp__gmail__draft_email({
     to: ["kate@electricsheepmusic.com"],
     subject: "[Generated subject]",
     body: "[Generated message]"
   })
   ```

6. **Generate summary report**
   ```
   ðŸ“ž MOK MUSIC FOLLOW-UP SUMMARY - [Date]

   OVERDUE ITEMS:
   â€¢ [Project] - [Days] days, $[Amount]

   MISSING POs:
   â€¢ [Project] - Ready for invoicing

   APRA PENDING:
   â€¢ [Project] - Registration required

   ACTIONS TAKEN:
   â€¢ [Summary of communications]

   NEXT STEPS:
