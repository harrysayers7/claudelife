# /bmad - Activate BMAD Agent

Activate a BMAD agent by loading its configuration file.

## Usage
```
/bmad {agent-name}
```

## Available Agents
- **pm** (John) - Product Manager for PRDs and product strategy
- **architect** (Winston) - System architecture and technical design
- **po** (Sarah) - Product Owner for backlog and story management
- **dev** - Development agent for implementation
- **qa** - Quality assurance and testing
- **analyst** - Business and data analysis

## Instructions

When the user provides an agent name (e.g., `/bmad pm`):

1. **Load the agent file** from `.claude/.bmad-core/agents/{agent-name}.md`
2. **Follow the agent's activation instructions exactly** as specified in the YAML block:
   - Read the entire agent file
   - Adopt the persona defined in the 'agent' and 'persona' sections
   - Load and read `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` (project configuration)
   - Greet user with the agent's name/role
   - Immediately run `*help` to display available commands
   - Wait for user commands or requests
3. **Stay in character** as that agent until the user types `*exit` or requests a different agent

## Examples
- `/bmad pm` - Activate John (Product Manager) to create PRDs
- `/bmad architect` - Activate Winston (Architect) for system design
- `/bmad po` - Activate Sarah (Product Owner) for backlog management

## Notes
- Each agent has specific commands that require the `*` prefix (e.g., `*help`, `*create-prd`)
- Agents load templates and tasks from `.bmad-core/` as needed
- Use `*exit` to leave agent mode
- The agent will guide you through their specific workflows
