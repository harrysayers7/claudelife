# MOK HOUSE Master Primer

This command loads essential MOK HOUSE business context into the main conversation, enabling intelligent creative business assistance without invoking heavy sub-agents.

## Purpose

Transform the main Claude conversation into a MOK HOUSE-aware creative partner by:
- Loading core business model and Indigenous positioning
- Establishing knowledge source hierarchy (Graphiti ‚Üí Dashboard ‚Üí Projects)
- Checking current business status (financials, active projects)
- Enabling smart routing to specialized knowledge as needed

**IMPORTANT**: Use Serena to search through the codebase. If you get any errors using Serena, retry with different Serena tools.

## Shortcut Name Rules

When user says:
- **"MH"** or **"mh"** ‚Üí means **MOK HOUSE** (this business, all caps, two words)
- **"PC"** ‚Üí means **Panda Candy**
- **"MK"** or **"mk"** ‚Üí means **MOKAI**

**Voice Transcription Note**: When Harry says "mock house" or "mok house", he means **MOK HOUSE**.

If Graphiti has recent MOK HOUSE data (last 7 days):
- Load client relationships and preferences
- Load recent project outcomes
- Load team member context

Else: Skip, query on demand during conversation

### Lazy Load (During Conversation)

Query these sources intelligently based on user questions:

1. **Graphiti Knowledge Graph** (fastest - check first)
   - Client relationships and creative preferences
   - Project outcomes and budgets
   - Team member roles and expertise
   - Winning patterns (why projects were won)
   - Invoice/PO numbers for specific projects

2. **Dashboard** (fast - check second)
   - Location: `/01-areas/business/mokhouse/mokhouse-dashboard.md`
   - Financial overview (paid, outstanding, pending)
   - Active projects and priorities
   - Recent wins and client relationships

3. **Project Files** (moderate - query specific projects)
   - Location: `/02-projects/mokhouse/`
   - Individual project details (briefs, creative direction, financials)
   - Client feedback and learnings
   - Technical requirements

4. **Diary Notes** (when timeline matters)
   - Location: `/01-areas/business/mokhouse/diary/YYYY-MM-DD-mokhouse-daily.md`
   - Daily creative work, client communications
   - Wins, learnings, insights
   - Context for future conversations

5. **Context Files** (detailed business info)
   - Location: `/01-areas/business/mokhouse/context-mokhouse.md`
   - `/01-areas/business/mokhouse/mokhouse-profile.md`
   - Business model details, financial context

## Process

When `/mokhouse-master` is executed:

### Step 1: Load Core Knowledge

Output to user:
```
‚úÖ MOK HOUSE Master Context Loading...

üìä Business Model: Creative house (MOK Music + MOK Studio)
üéØ Divisions: Music (active), Studio (future branding/design)
üí∞ Music Pricing: $5k-$30k+ projects | $250-$1k demo fees | $2.5k-$8k usage fees
üèÜ Indigenous Advantage: 100% Indigenous-owned, Supply Nation pending
üë§ Team: Harry (Owner/Composer), Kell (Operations), Glenn (ESM), Kate (ESM)
```

### Step 2: Check Current Business Status

Read dashboard for:
- Financial overview (paid, outstanding, pending)
- This Week's Focus
- Recent Wins
- Active Projects

Output to user:
```
üí∞ Financials: $X paid | $X outstanding | $X pending
üéµ Active Projects: [Count and key projects]
üèÜ Recent Wins: [Top 1-2 wins]
üìÖ This Week's Focus: [From dashboard]
```

### Step 3: Smart Graphiti Check

Query Graphiti for recent MOK HOUSE entities:
```javascript
// Search for clients, projects, team members from last 7 days
mcp__graphiti__search_memory_nodes({
  query: "MOK HOUSE clients projects team creative preferences",
  max_nodes: 10
})
```

If results found:
```
üîó Graphiti Context: Loaded X clients, Y projects, Z team members
```

Else:
```
üîó Graphiti: No recent data, will query on demand
```

### Step 4: Establish Knowledge Sources

Output to user:
```
üìö Knowledge Sources Mapped:
  1. Graphiti (fastest) - Client relationships, project outcomes, team
  2. Dashboard - Financial overview, active projects, priorities
  3. Project Files - Detailed briefs, creative direction, financials
  4. Diary - Daily creative work, learnings, timeline context

Ready for MOK HOUSE discussions: creative, clients, projects, financials
```

### Step 5: Smart Routing Intelligence

Enable intelligent query routing based on user questions:

**Client/Project Financial Questions** ‚Üí Query Graphiti + Dashboard
```javascript
// Example: "How much was the Nintendo job?"
mcp__graphiti__search_memory_facts({
  query: "Nintendo budget invoice usage fee",
  max_facts: 5
})

// Fallback: Read project file
mcp__serena__find_file({
  file_mask: "*nintendo*.md",
  relative_path: "02-projects/mokhouse"
})
```

**Creative Direction Questions** ‚Üí Read Project Files
```javascript
// Example: "What was the Nintendo brief?"
mcp__serena__search_for_pattern({
  substring_pattern: "CREATIVE DIRECTION|TONE & EMOTION",
  relative_path: "02-projects/mokhouse/036-nintendo",
  context_lines_after: 20
})
```

**Financial Overview Questions** ‚Üí Read Dashboard
```javascript
// Example: "What's outstanding?"
Read: /01-areas/business/mokhouse/mokhouse-dashboard.md
```

**Timeline Questions** ‚Üí Query Diary
```javascript
// Example: "What did I work on last week?"
mcp__serena__list_dir({
  relative_path: "01-areas/business/mokhouse/diary",
  recursive: false
})
```

### Step 6: Automatic Knowledge Capture (Graphiti)

Enable intelligent knowledge capture during MOK HOUSE conversations:

**What gets stored automatically (silent):**
- Client creative preferences and feedback
- Project outcomes (won/lost, budgets, invoice numbers)
- Team member expertise and roles
- Winning patterns ("Won because X, Y, Z")
- Creative direction that resonated
- Technical requirements and formats

**Detection triggers:**
```javascript
// Automatic Graphiti storage when detecting:
- "Nintendo wants..." / "Client prefers..."
- "We won this project because..."
- "Invoice #ABC123 for $X"
- "Glenn suggested..." / "Kate mentioned..."
- "This creative direction worked well..."
- "PO number XYZ for project ABC"

// Example automatic storage:
User: "Won Nintendo Exchange Mode - $3,250 usage fee. Client loved the sweet, endearing tone."

Claude: [Detects: project win with creative insight]
        [Automatically stores in Graphiti]
        üîó Stored: Nintendo Exchange Mode win ($3,250)
        üí° Pattern: "Sweet, endearing tone" resonates with Nintendo

        (Continues conversation seamlessly)
```

**Graphiti storage pattern:**
```javascript
mcp__graphiti__add_memory({
  name: "MOK HOUSE project outcome - Nintendo Exchange Mode",
  episode_body: `During MOK HOUSE discussion on 2025-10-18:

  Project: Nintendo Exchange Mode
  Client: Nintendo (via Electric Sheep Music)
  Outcome: WON
  Budget: $3,250 usage fee
  Creative Direction: Sweet, endearing, story-focused
  Client Feedback: "Loved the tone - adorable sigh at the end"
  Why Won: Followed reference track closely, polished production
  Invoice: [Invoice number]
  PO: [PO number if available]

  Pattern: Nintendo responds well to heartwarming, story-driven scores with Japanese influences.`,
  group_id: "mokhouse",
  source: "message"
})
```

**What to capture for each project:**
- Client name and preferences
- Budget (demo fee, usage fee, total)
- Won/Lost status and why
- Invoice/PO numbers
- Creative direction that worked
- Client feedback (quoted)
- Team members involved
- Technical requirements

## Smart Detection Examples

- Demo Fee: $650
- Invoice #: [from metadata]
- Status: [Current status]"
```

```
