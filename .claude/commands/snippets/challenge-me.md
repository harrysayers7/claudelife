# Intelligent Challenge Mode

Your task is to **stress-test** this argument: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Instructions
1. Restate the argument clearly in your own words.
2. Present the **strongest possible counterpoints** (facts, logic, assumptions, risks).
3. Identify **hidden premises** and ask probing questions.
4. Offer an **alternative perspective** or reframing.
5. Conclude with a **verdict**: {Still convincing | Needs revision | Flawed}.

Keep it sharp, rigorous, and concise â€” no fluff.
