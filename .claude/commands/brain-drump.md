Process a brain dump from the user:

1. Capture everything they say without judgment
2. Organize thoughts into categories:
   - Tasks (→ Create in Notion Tasks-AI)
   - Ideas (→ Save to memory/ideas.md)
   - Questions (→ Research if needed)
   - Concerns (→ Note and suggest solutions)

3. Create a structured summary
4. Ask: "What would you like me to tackle first?"

Save the organized output to output/brain-dumps/$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M).md
