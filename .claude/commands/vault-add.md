  Creates secure vault entries for frequently-referenced information like bank details, API keys, passwords, ID numbers, tax info, and company credentials. Generates structured markdown files with YAML frontmatter (type: vault, entity relation, sensitivity level, category). Stores in entity-specific folders (04-resources/vault/{entity}/) and automatically manages .gitignore for sensitive items. Supports both reference info (bank accounts, ABN) and credentials (API keys, passwords) with appropriate security warnings.
examples:
  - /vault-add "MOKAI Commonwealth Bank business account details"
  - /vault-add "Supabase API keys for production database"
  - /vault-add "ABN and ACN for MOK HOUSE PTY LTD"
  - /vault-add "Stripe secret keys and webhook endpoints"

# Vault Add

This command helps you create secure, structured vault entries for frequently-needed information that's annoying to search for repeatedly. Handles both non-sensitive reference info (bank details, ID numbers, company info) and sensitive credentials (API keys, passwords, tokens) with automatic .gitignore protection.

## Usage

```bash
/vault-add "description of what to add"

# OR provide structured input directly
/vault-add "API Name: Supabase Production
API Key: sb_prod_xxxxxxx
Project ID: abc123xyz
URL: https://abc123xyz.supabase.co"

# OR reference current conversation context
/vault-add "add these Stripe keys to vault"
```

## Interactive Process

When you run this command, I will:

1. **Analyze your input** to determine:
   - What type of vault item (bank details, API key, ID number, license, password, etc.)
   - Which entity it relates to (MOKAI, MOK HOUSE, Personal, or other)
   - Sensitivity level (reference info vs. credentials)

2. **Ask clarifying questions** if needed:
   - Item name/title for the vault entry
   - Which entity this relates to (for proper folder organization)
   - Additional fields specific to the item type
   - Whether this is sensitive data requiring .gitignore protection

3. **Generate the vault file** in appropriate location:
   - Reference info: `04-resources/vault/{entity}/{Item Name}.md`
   - Sensitive credentials: Same location, but added to .gitignore

4. **Update .gitignore** automatically if the item is marked as sensitive

5. **Confirm creation** and show file location for future reference

## Input Requirements

You can provide vault information in three ways:

1. **Quick description**: `/vault-add "MOKAI bank account details"`
   - I'll ask follow-up questions to gather specifics

2. **Structured input**: Paste formatted info directly
   ```
   /vault-add "Account Name: MOKAI PTY LTD
   BSB: 123-456
   Account Number: 12345678
   Bank: Commonwealth Bank
   Swift: CTBAAU2S"
   ```

3. **Context reference**: If we just discussed API keys or credentials in conversation
   ```
   /vault-add "add those Supabase credentials to vault"
   ```

## Process

**IMPORTANT**: Use Serena to search through the codebase. If you get any errors using Serena, retry with different Serena tools.

I'll help you create a vault entry by:

1. **Determining vault item type**:
   - Bank account (BSB, account number, SWIFT, bank name)
   - API credentials (API key, secret, project ID, endpoints)
   - Tax identifiers (ABN, ACN, TFN, GST registration)
   - ID numbers (company registration, business licenses)
   - Passwords (service logins, admin credentials)
   - License keys (software licenses, certifications)
   - Insurance details (policy numbers, provider info)

2. **Structuring YAML frontmatter**:
   ```yaml
   type: vault
   entity_type: bank | api | tax | license | password | id-number | insurance
   name: Item name (e.g., "MOKAI Commonwealth Account")
   relation: [["mokai"]] | [["mokhouse"]] | [["personal"]]
   category: bank-details | api-key | tax-info | license | credential | id-number
   sensitive: true | false  # Determines .gitignore treatment
   tags: [searchable, keywords, for, filtering]
   last_verified: YYYY-MM-DD  # When info was last confirmed current
   expiry_date: YYYY-MM-DD    # For licenses, credentials that expire
   date created: Day, MM DD YY, HH:MM:SS am/pm
   date modified: Day, MM DD YY, HH:MM:SS am/pm
   ```

3. **Creating structured content sections**:
   - **Details**: Key-value pairs for the actual information
   - **Access/Usage**: How to use these credentials or where they apply
   - **Related Information**: Links, contact info, documentation
   - **Security Notes**: Special instructions or warnings
   - **Notes**: Any additional context

4. **Organizing by entity**:
   - MOKAI items ‚Üí `04-resources/vault/mokai/`
   - MOK HOUSE items ‚Üí `04-resources/vault/mokhouse/`
   - Personal items ‚Üí `04-resources/vault/personal/`
   - Other entities ‚Üí `04-resources/vault/{entity-name}/`

5. **Managing .gitignore**:
   - If `sensitive: true`, add file path to `.gitignore`
   - Verify .gitignore entry was added successfully
   - Warn user to never commit sensitive vault files

6. **Validating completeness**:
   - Ensure all required frontmatter fields populated
   - Verify entity folder structure exists (create if needed)
   - Confirm file saved in correct location

### File Naming Convention

```javascript
// Format: Entity-specific folders with descriptive names
const entityFolder = `04-resources/vault/${entity.toLowerCase()}/`;
const fileName = `${itemName}.md`;  // Human-readable name
const filePath = `${entityFolder}${fileName}`;

// Examples:
// 04-resources/vault/mokai/Commonwealth Bank Account.md
// 04-resources/vault/mokai/Supabase Production API.md
// 04-resources/vault/mokhouse/Stripe API Keys.md
// 04-resources/vault/personal/Passport Details.md
```

### .gitignore Management

When `sensitive: true`, automatically append to `.gitignore`:

```bash
# Sensitive vault entries (auto-generated by /vault-add)
04-resources/vault/**/Supabase Production API.md
04-resources/vault/**/Stripe API Keys.md
04-resources/vault/**/Admin Passwords.md
```

**Security Protocol**:
1. Check if file path already in .gitignore
2. If not, append to .gitignore with comment
3. Verify addition with `git check-ignore` command
4. Warn user to verify .gitignore before committing

## Output Format

I'll provide:

1. **Vault entry summary**:
   - Item name and type
   - Entity association (MOKAI/MOK HOUSE/Personal)
   - Sensitivity level
   - File location

2. **File creation confirmation**:
   - Full file path for future reference
   - .gitignore status (added/already ignored/not sensitive)

3. **Security reminder** (for sensitive items):
   - Warning about git commits
   - Recommendation to verify .gitignore
   - Suggestion to use environment variables for runtime access

4. **Quick access tip**:
   - How to search for this item (by entity, tags, keywords)
   - Related vault items you might need

## Related Resources

- Template: `98-templates/vault.md` (to be created)
- Vault root: `04-resources/vault/`
- Entity folders: `04-resources/vault/{mokai|mokhouse|personal}/`
- .gitignore: Root `.gitignore` file

## Security Best Practices

### What to Store in Vault
‚úÖ Bank account details (BSB, account number)
‚úÖ Tax identifiers (ABN, ACN, TFN)
‚úÖ API keys and tokens (with .gitignore)
‚úÖ Passwords and credentials (with .gitignore)
‚úÖ License keys and certificates
‚úÖ Insurance policy numbers
‚úÖ Company registration details

### What NOT to Store in Vault
‚ùå Credit card CVV codes (regenerate each use)
‚ùå Temporary access tokens (use environment variables)
‚ùå Personal passwords for non-business accounts
‚ùå Social security numbers (unless absolutely necessary)

### Security Workflow
1. Create vault entry with `sensitive: true`
2. Verify .gitignore addition before git operations
3. For runtime access, copy to environment variables
4. Regularly verify `git status` shows vault files as ignored
5. Never email or message vault file contents directly

---

**Ready to add a vault entry. Provide:**
- What information you want to store (description or structured data)
- Which entity it relates to (MOKAI/MOK HOUSE/Personal/Other)
- Whether it's sensitive (credentials/keys) or reference info (account numbers/IDs)

I'll create a structured vault entry with proper frontmatter, organization, and security handling.
