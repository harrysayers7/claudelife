## Tax & Accounting Considerations

**GST:**
Pty Ltd registered for GST (required for government/corporate contracts).

**Invoicing:**
Invoices must include ABN, entity name, trading name, GST status, and Indigenous ownership (for Supply Nation compliance).

**Tax Treatment:**
• Income streams are split between project-based fees (MOK Music + Studio) and recurring retainers (Studio).
• Potential eligibility for R&D incentives for creative tech/automation projects if structured correctly.
• Music licensing overseas may attract export income concessions.
• Eligible for Indigenous-business grants, state creative industries programs, and federal IPP set-asides.
• Consider internal cost-centre tracking (MOK Music vs MOK Studio) for clear reporting.

---

## Key Business Risks to Flag for Accountants

• **Cash Flow Management:** Lumpy music projects vs smoother retainers require a working capital buffer.
• **High Contractor Use:** Session musicians, designers, media buyers—ensure proper PAYG/contractor compliance.
• **Cross-Border Income:** Music placements/licensing may trigger withholding tax in overseas jurisdictions.
• **Certification Leverage:** Supply Nation status must be maintained with correct Indigenous ownership structure (Harry 100% equity).

---

## Summary for Financial Professionals

**MOK HOUSE Pty Ltd** is a multidisciplinary Indigenous creative house built on two revenue legs:

1. **MOK Music** – Project-based music/sonic branding for ads, corporates, and cultural clients.
2. **MOK Studio** – Scalable branding, design, content, and paid media retainers for corporate/government buyers.

With Supply Nation certification pending, MOK HOUSE is positioned to capture both Indigenous procurement contracts and premium boutique creative work. Structuring around GST compliance, project vs retainer income, contractor management, and R&D/grant opportunities will be critical for maximising tax efficiency and maintaining eligibility for government work.
