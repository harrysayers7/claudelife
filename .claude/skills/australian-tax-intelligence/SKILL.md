# Australian Tax Intelligence

Tax knowledge system for Harry's multi-entity business with automatic knowledge building via Graphiti (facts) and Serena (patterns).

## When to Use This Skill

Automatically activate when user mentions:
- **Tax concepts**: deduction, write-off, tax bracket, franking credits, BAS
- **GST**: threshold, registration, turnover, compliance
- **Entities**: MOKAI, MOK HOUSE, SAFIA, Family Trust, sole trader
- **Income**: APRA royalties, salary, dividend, distributions
- **Assets**: Tesla, home office, musical instruments
- **Questions**: "Is X deductible?", "What's my tax on Y?", "Should I register for GST?"

## Knowledge Architecture (Three-Layer System)

### Layer 1: Entity Facts & Relationships ‚Üí Graphiti MCP

**What Graphiti stores**:
- Entity ownership (Harry owns MOK HOUSE ‚Üí transferring to HS Family Trust)
- Asset details (Tesla loan $90,254 @ 4.23%, balloon $41,676.82 Dec 2026)
- Deduction rules (Gym: NEVER deductible, Instruments: YES deductible)
- Financial events (SAFIA show $60K on [date], Invoice overdue since [date])
- Income thresholds (Harry target <$45K for 19% bracket)

**Query pattern**:
```javascript
mcp__graphiti__search_memory_facts({
  query: "[entity/asset/income] tax deductible rules ownership"
})
```

### Layer 2: Calculation Methods & Patterns ‚Üí Serena MCP

**What Serena stores**:
- Deduction calculation methods (Logbook vs cents/km for vehicles)
- Database schema (Supabase column names, table relationships)
- File locations (Financial reports ‚Üí 01-areas/finance/analysis/)
- Workflow patterns (Cash flow: 3-month rolling average for APRA)
- Tax strategies (Distribute to Wife first to minimize 32.5% bracket)

**Query pattern**:
```javascript
mcp__serena__read_memory({
  memory_file_name: "harry_tax_deduction_patterns"
})
```

### Layer 3: Tax Law & Rates ‚Üí Skill Reference Files

**What skill provides**:
- Australian tax rates (FY2025-26 brackets)
- GST rules (threshold $75K, registration timing)
- Company/trust tax rates (25% base rate entity, 45% accumulation)
- General deduction principles (Section 8-1 ITAA 1997)

**Load pattern**: Reference files on-demand only

---

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Deduction Validation

**User asks**: "Is [expense] tax deductible?"

**Steps**:
1. **Check Graphiti first** (instant answer if rule exists):
   ```javascript
   mcp__graphiti__search_memory_facts({
     query: "[expense] tax deductible Harry business"
   })
   ```

2. **If no rule in Graphiti**, apply general tax principles:
   - Section 8-1: Incurred in gaining/producing assessable income?
   - Nexus to income-producing activity?
   - Not capital, private, or domestic?

3. **Validate against known patterns** (from Serena if complex calculation):
   ```javascript
   mcp__serena__read_memory({
     memory_file_name: "harry_tax_deduction_patterns"
   })
   ```

4. **Provide answer with reasoning**:
   ```markdown
   ‚úÖ/‚ùå [Expense] is/is not tax deductible

   **Reasoning**: [Why based on tax law + Harry's situation]
   **Category**: [Expense type]
   **Apportionment**: [If partial, show %]
   **Evidence required**: [Receipt, logbook, etc.]
   ```

5. **Store new rule** (automatic):
   ```javascript
   // Store in Graphiti for instant future lookup
   mcp__graphiti__add_memory({
     name: "Deduction Rule Discovery",
     episode_body: "[Expense] is [deductible/not deductible] because [reason]",
     source: "message",
     group_id: "harry-financial-entities"
   })
   ```

6. **Suggest pattern** (if recurring expense type):
   ```markdown
   üí° **Pattern detected**: This expense type appears regularly.

   Should I store the calculation method in Serena?
   - Pattern: "[Expense category] ‚Üí [Deduction method]"
   - Future benefit: Instant validation without re-analysis

   [Store pattern] [Skip]
   ```

See: `workflows/deduction-validation.md` for detailed workflow

---

### Workflow 2: GST Threshold Monitoring

**User mentions**: entity name, turnover, GST registration

**Steps**:
1. **Query Graphiti for current status**:
   ```javascript
   mcp__graphiti__search_memory_facts({
     query: "[entity] GST registered turnover threshold FY2025-26"
   })
   ```

2. **Calculate threshold percentage**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/validate_gst_threshold.py [current_turnover]
   ```

   Returns:
   ```json
   {
     "current_turnover": 52000,
     "threshold": 75000,
     "percentage": 69.3,
     "should_alert": false,
     "recommendation": null
   }
   ```

3. **If >70% threshold**:
   ```markdown
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **GST Threshold Alert**

   **Entity**: [Name]
   **Progress**: 69.3% of $75,000 threshold
   **Current turnover**: $52,000 (FY2025-26)

   **Recommendations**:
   - Monitor monthly turnover closely
   - Project annual turnover based on current rate
   - Register for GST if projection indicates threshold breach
   - Prepare for GST obligations (pricing, invoicing, BAS)
   ```

4. **Store status in Graphiti**:
   ```javascript
   mcp__graphiti__add_memory({
     name: "GST Threshold Update",
     episode_body: "[Entity] turnover $52K (69.3% of threshold) as at [date]",
     source: "message",
     group_id: "harry-financial-entities"
   })
   ```

See: `workflows/gst-threshold-check.md` for monitoring schedule

---

### Workflow 3: Trust Distribution Optimization

**User asks**: "Optimize trust distributions" or "What's best tax structure?"

**Steps**:
1. **Query Graphiti for income data**:
   ```javascript
   mcp__graphiti__search_memory_facts({
     query: "Harry Wife income FY2025-26 salary APRA SAFIA"
   })
   ```

2. **Query Serena for distribution strategy**:
   ```javascript
   mcp__serena__read_memory({
     memory_file_name: "harry_tax_deduction_patterns"
   })
   ```

3. **Calculate tax scenarios**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/optimize_trust_distribution.py \
     --harry-income 35000 \
     --wife-income 48000 \
     --trust-income 40000
   ```

4. **Present optimization**:
   ```markdown
   ## Trust Distribution Analysis

   ### Current Structure (No Trust Distribution)
   - Harry: $35K APRA + $0 MOK HOUSE = $35K ‚Üí Tax: $3,420
   - Wife: $48K employment ‚Üí Tax: $7,020
   - **Total family tax**: $10,440

   ### Optimized (With Trust Distribution)
   - Harry: $35K APRA + $10K trust = $45K ‚Üí Tax: $5,520
   - Wife: $48K employment + $0 trust = $48K ‚Üí Tax: $7,020
   - Trust distributes: $40K (Wife $30K, Harry $10K)
   - **Total family tax**: $12,540

   ### Analysis
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Trust distribution increases tax by $2,100 in this scenario

   **Reason**: Both already in 19% bracket, trust income pushes toward 32.5%
   **Better strategy**: Retain income in company, pay when beneficial
   ```

5. **Store strategy in Serena** (if user confirms):
   ```javascript
   mcp__serena__write_memory({
     memory_name: "harry_tax_deduction_patterns",
     content: "## Trust Distribution Strategy\n\n..." // Append pattern
   })
   ```

See: `workflows/trust-optimization.md` for calculation method
