## Quick Reference Formulas

### Calculate Tax on Income (Resident)

```
Income $0 - $18,200: $0
Income $18,201 - $45,000: (Income - $18,200) × 0.19
Income $45,001 - $135,000: $5,092 + (Income - $45,000) × 0.325
Income $135,001 - $190,000: $34,342 + (Income - $135,000) × 0.37
Income $190,001+: $54,692 + (Income - $190,000) × 0.45
```

### Calculate GST Threshold %

```
Threshold % = (Current Turnover / $75,000) × 100
Alert if >70% ($52,500)
```

### Calculate Company Tax (BRE)

```
Company Tax = Assessable Income × 0.25
Net profit = Assessable Income - Tax
```

### Calculate Franking Credits

```
If dividend $75 (after 25% tax):
Gross dividend = $75 / (1 - 0.25) = $100
Franking credit = $100 - $75 = $25
```
