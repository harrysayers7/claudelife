Annual deduction = Cost / Effective life
```

**Effective lives** (ATO determination):

  - Deduct $100 in FY2025-26 (1 month)
  - Deduct $1,100 in FY2026-27 (11 months)

### Capital vs Revenue
- **Capital**: Enduring asset (depreciate)
- **Revenue**: Repairs/maintenance (immediate deduction)

**Examples**:
- ✅ Revenue: Servicing Tesla ($500) - immediate deduction
- ❌ Capital: Engine replacement ($10,000) - may be capital

### Private Use Adjustment

1. Calculate total expense
2. Apply business use %
3. Claim business portion only

**Example** (Tesla):
- Total interest: $4,000/year
- Business use: 50%
- Deduction: $4,000 × 50% = $2,000
