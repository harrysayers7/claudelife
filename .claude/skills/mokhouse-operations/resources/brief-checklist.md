## Questions to Ask if Unclear

**Creative:**

- Any cultural considerations to be aware of?

**Technical:**
- What is the exact frame rate if video sync required?
- Are there specific loudness standards (LUFS)?
- Who is the final approval authority?

**Commercial:**
- What territories/media is the usage for?
- What is the campaign duration?
- Are there potential extensions or additional usage?
- When can we expect decision/payment?

## Red Flags to Watch For

- [ ] Unrealistic timeline (less than 3 days for complex brief)
- [ ] Vague creative direction with no references
- [ ] Unclear budget or "exposure only" compensation
- [ ] Rights transfer beyond typical advertising usage
- [ ] No clear decision timeline
- [ ] Technical specs don't match creative brief
