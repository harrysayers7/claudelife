  goal: "Build muscle while losing fat (body recomposition)"
  notes: "Flexible 3-day ABC rotation - 20-30 min cardio warmup + 30-40 min lifting = 60 min total"

    timing: "Pre-workout (before lifting)"
    purpose: "Warmup + fat loss, acts as extended cardio warmup before strength work"
    note: "Good for body recomp - cardio first won't significantly impact lifting performance at this intensity"

    - "Foam rolling 10 min (especially upper back)"

  warmup_cardio:
    description: "Pre-workout cardio warmup (already part of your routine)"
    protocol: "20-30 min incline treadmill walking at 4.8 km/h, incline 9"
    purpose: "Extended warmup + fat loss without impacting lifting performance"
    timing: "BEFORE lifting, part of 60-min total gym time"
    note: "This intensity won't negatively impact strength work - acts as active warmup"

adaptation_rules:

  poor_sleep_threshold: 6  # /10
  high_stress_threshold: 7  # /10
  back_pain_threshold: "Moderate"

  adaptations:
    tired_but_ok:
      condition: "energy < 7 AND sleep > 5"
      action: "Reduce volume by 1 set per exercise, keep weight/RPE same"
      example: "4x6-8 bench becomes 3x6-8"

    very_tired:
      condition: "energy < 6 OR sleep < 5"
      action: "Do Day C instead of planned day (lighter pump work)"
      rationale: "Something is better than nothing, Day C is easiest to recover from"

    high_stress:
      condition: "stress > 7"
      action: "Drop RPE to 6-7, focus on movement quality over load"
      example: "RPE 8 becomes RPE 6-7, reduce weight if needed"

    back_discomfort:
      condition: "back soreness >= Moderate OR pain keywords detected"
      action: "Skip all leg exercises, do upper body only + light core work"
      safety: "Do NOT push through back pain - modify or skip"
      example:
        day_a: "Do Bench, Incline DB, Shoulder Press, Lateral Raises, Triceps only"
        day_b: "Do Lat Pulldown, Chest Row, Cable Row, Face Pulls, Biceps only"
        day_c: "Do upper body exercises only, skip leg press/extension"

    missed_session:
      condition: "Can't make planned training day"
      action: "Just do next workout in ABC sequence when you can - no make-up needed"
      example: "Missed Day A on Monday? Do Day A on Thursday instead"
      rationale: "3-day program is forgiving, consistency over perfection"

progression_strategy:
  method: "Rep Progression (Double Progression)"
  description: "Add reps before adding weight - safer and more sustainable"

  steps:
    step_1: "Start at bottom of rep range with challenging weight (RPE 7-8)"
    step_2: "Add 1-2 reps per week per set until you hit top of range"
    step_3: "When ALL sets hit top range, increase weight and drop back to bottom reps"
    step_4: "Repeat cycle"

  examples:
    bench_press:
      week_1: "60kg: 6, 6, 6, 6 (RPE 8)"
      week_2: "60kg: 7, 7, 6, 6 (RPE 8)"
      week_3: "60kg: 8, 8, 7, 7 (RPE 8)"
      week_4: "62.5kg: 6, 6, 6, 6 (RPE 8) ← weight increased"

body_recomposition_notes:
  nutrition_reminder: "Body recomp requires calorie deficit + high protein"
  protein_target: "1.8-2.2g per kg bodyweight"
  calorie_approach: "Small deficit (10-20% below maintenance)"

  training_emphasis:
    - "Progressive overload is KEY - must get stronger to build muscle"
    - "RPE 7-8 is sweet spot - enough stimulus without excessive fatigue"
    - "Consistency > Intensity - 3x/week every week beats 5x/week inconsistently"
    - "Leg work is critical - biggest calorie burn and muscle mass"

  recovery_priority:
    - "Sleep 7-9 hours for fat loss + muscle retention"
    - "Manage stress - high cortisol kills body recomp"
    - "Don't add extra cardio unless recovery is good"

    - "Chest-Supported Rows (no lower back stress)"
    - "Cable Crunches (core without spinal flexion under load)"

notes:
  - "RPE Scale: 6 = 4 reps in reserve, 7 = 3 RIR, 8 = 2 RIR, 9 = 1 RIR"
  - "Primary exercises (marked primary: true) get 1.3x XP multiplier"
  - "Form quality 9-10/10 gets 1.15x XP bonus for body recomp focus"
  - "Consistency bonus: 3 sessions/week for 4 straight weeks = 1000 bonus XP"
  - "This is a FLEXIBLE program - life happens, just maintain ABC sequence"
  - "Back safety is priority #1 - never push through back pain"
