# Body Recomposition Training Guide
## Your Personalized 3-Day Program

This guide documents your customized training program optimized for body recomposition (simultaneous muscle building and fat loss) within a 60-minute total gym time constraint.

---

## Program Overview

### Core Philosophy
- **Goal**: Build muscle while losing fat through disciplined training + nutrition strategy
- **Duration**: 8-week blocks with deload every 6 weeks
- **Training Frequency**: 3 sessions per week (ABC rotation)
- **Session Structure**: 20-30 min pre-workout cardio + 30-35 min lifting = 60 min total
- **RPE Philosophy**: RPE 8 is IDEAL (rewarded), RPE 9+ is PENALIZED (avoid overtraining in deficit)
- **Form Priority**: Excellent form (9-10/10) gets 15% XP bonus - critical for muscle retention during fat loss

### Time Management Strategy
Your program uses **time-efficient techniques** to fit quality training into 60 minutes:

1. **Pre-Workout Cardio as Warmup** (20-30 min)
   - Replaces traditional 5-10 min warmup
   - Low intensity (4.8 km/h, incline 9) won't fatigue muscles for lifting
   - Increases blood flow, core temperature, and fat burning

2. **Reduced Rest Periods**
   - Primary lifts: 90-120 seconds (vs traditional 180s)
   - Secondary exercises: 75-90 seconds (vs traditional 120s)
   - Accessories: 45 seconds (vs traditional 60s)

3. **Strategic Supersets**
   - Day A: Lateral Raises + Tricep Pushdowns (saves ~3 min)
   - Day B: Face Pulls + Bicep Curls (saves ~2 min)
   - Day C: Leg Extension + Cable Crunches (saves ~2 min)

**Result**: Day A/B = ~35 min lifting, Day C = ~30 min lifting (all under 60 min total with cardio)

## Weekly Structure

### Schedule Options (Pick Any 3 Non-Consecutive Days)

**Ideal Pattern**: Monday, Wednesday, Friday
**Alternative 1**: Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday
**Alternative 2**: Monday, Thursday, Saturday

**Rule**: Maintain ABC sequence on whatever days you train (Day A → Day B → Day C, repeat)

### Flexible Scheduling Example
```
Week 1: Mon (Day A), Wed (Day B), Fri (Day C)
Week 2: Tue (Day A), Thu (Day B), Sat (Day C)
Week 3: Mon (Day A), Wed (Day B), Sat (Day C)
```

## Session Template

### Pre-Workout Routine (20-30 minutes)
**Incline Treadmill Walking**
- Speed: 4.8 km/h (conversational pace)
- Incline: 9
- Purpose: Extended warmup + fat loss without impacting lifting performance
- Note: This intensity acts as active warmup, not fatiguing cardio

### Lifting Session (30-35 minutes)
1. Primary compound exercises (2 per session)
2. Secondary movements
3. Accessory work with supersets

## XP Gamification System

### How XP is Calculated

**Base XP Formula**: `weight_kg × reps_completed`

**Multipliers Stack Multiplicatively**:
```
Total XP = Base XP × RPE_mult × Form_mult × Exercise_Type_mult × Achievement_mult
```

### RPE Multipliers (Body Recomp Optimized)

| RPE Level | Multiplier | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| 9-10 | **0.95x** (PENALTY) | Discouraged - overtraining risk in calorie deficit |
| 8 | **1.1x** (BONUS) | **IDEAL** - sweet spot for body recomp |
| 7 | **1.05x** (BONUS) | Good for volume/accessory work |
| <7 | **0.9x** (PENALTY) | Insufficient stimulus |

**Key Insight**: RPE 8 with excellent form earns MORE XP than RPE 9+ with compromised form

### Form Quality Multipliers

| Form Rating | Multiplier | Description |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| 9-10/10 | **1.15x** | Excellent - CRITICAL for body recomp |
| 7-8/10 | **1.0x** | Good - no bonus/penalty |
| <7/10 | **0.75x** | Poor - 25% penalty (injury risk) |

### Exercise Type Multipliers

| Exercise Type | Multiplier | Examples |
|---------------|------------|----------|
| Primary/Compound | **1.3x** | Bench Press, Leg Press, Lat Pulldown, Chest-Supported Row |
| Accessory | **1.0x** | All other exercises |

### Achievement Multipliers

| Achievement | Multiplier | When Applied |
|-------------|------------|--------------|
| Personal Record (PR) | **2.0x** | New max weight/reps |
| First Time Exercise | **1.5x** | First time performing movement |
| All Sets Complete | **1.1x** | Hit target reps on all sets |

### XP Examples

#### Example 1: IDEAL Body Recomp Set
**Bench Press: 62.5kg × 8 reps, RPE 8, Form 9/10, Primary**
```
Base XP = 62.5 × 8 = 500
RPE multiplier = 1.1 (RPE 8 - ideal)
Form multiplier = 1.15 (form 9/10 - excellent)
Primary multiplier = 1.3
Total XP = 500 × 1.1 × 1.15 × 1.3 = 823 XP
```
**This is the PERFECT body recomp set** - RPE 8 + excellent form

#### Example 2: Accessory Work
**Lateral Raises: 10kg × 15 reps, RPE 7, Form 8/10**
```
Base XP = 10 × 15 = 150
RPE multiplier = 1.05 (RPE 7 - good for accessories)
Form multiplier = 1.0 (form 8/10 - good)
Accessory multiplier = 1.0
Total XP = 150 × 1.05 × 1.0 × 1.0 = 158 XP
```

#### Example 3: OVERTRAINING Example (Avoid This)
**Leg Press: 120kg × 10 reps, RPE 9, Form 7/10, Primary**
```
Base XP = 120 × 10 = 1200
RPE multiplier = 0.95 (RPE 9 - PENALIZED)
Form multiplier = 1.0 (form 7/10)
Primary multiplier = 1.3
Total XP = 1200 × 0.95 × 1.0 × 1.3 = 1482 XP
```
**Note**: Lower XP than RPE 8 would give - **AVOID RPE 9+ during fat loss**

### Weekly Consistency Bonuses (3-Day Specific)

| Bonus | XP | Requirement |
|-------|----|-----------  |
| **Three Session Week** | 750 XP | Complete all 3 planned sessions (ABC) |
| **Four Week Consistency** | 2000 XP | 3 sessions/week for 4 straight weeks (12 total) |
| **Perfect Form Week** | 1000 XP | Average form 9+ for entire week |
| **RPE Discipline Week** | 500 XP | Hit RPE 7-8 on 90%+ of sets |
| **Cardio Consistency** | 300 XP | Pre-workout cardio on all 3 training days |

### Level System

**10,000 XP = 1 Level**

| Level | Title | Reward |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 5 | Novice Lifter | Unlock advanced exercise variations |
| 10 | Intermediate Lifter | Unlock periodization templates |
| 15 | Advanced Lifter | Unlock custom program builder |
| 20 | Elite Lifter | Unlock competition prep protocols |

## Progressive Overload Strategy

### Method: Double Progression (Rep Progression First)

**Add reps before adding weight** - safer and more sustainable for body recomp

### 4-Step Process

1. **Start at bottom of rep range** with challenging weight (RPE 7-8)
2. **Add 1-2 reps per week** per set until you hit top of range
3. **When ALL sets hit top range**, increase weight and drop back to bottom reps
4. **Repeat cycle**

### When to Progress

✅ **Progress when:**
- All sets hit target reps at target RPE for 2+ sessions
- Form quality remains 8+/10
- Recovery adequate (energy 7+/10, sleep 7+/10)
- No pain or injury present
- Last deload was <6 weeks ago

❌ **Don't progress when:**
- Form breaks down
- RPE exceeds target by 2+ points
- Experiencing pain or injury
- Recovery compromised (sick, stressed, poor sleep)

### Realistic 8-Week Targets

Starting from Week 1 baseline:

| Exercise | Week 1 | Week 8 Target |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| Bench Press | 60-62.5kg | 67.5-70kg |
| Incline DB Press | 20kg dumbbells | 24-26kg dumbbells |
| DB Shoulder Press | 15-17kg dumbbells | 18-20kg dumbbells |
| Leg Press | 100-120kg | 140-160kg |
| Lat Pulldown | 50-55kg | 60-65kg |
| Chest-Supported Row | 40-45kg | 50-55kg |

---

## Recovery Protocols

### Deload Strategy

**Frequency**: Every 6 weeks
**Volume**: 60% of normal (reduce sets)
**Intensity**: 85% of normal weight

**Example Deload Week**:
- Bench Press: 3×6 @ 50kg (vs normal 4×6-8 @ 60kg)
- Leg Press: 3×10 @ 85kg (vs normal 4×10-12 @ 100kg)

### Rest Day Activities

1. **Light walking** 20-30 min (helps fat loss without impacting recovery)
2. **Stretching/yoga** 15 min
3. **Foam rolling** 10 min (especially upper back)

### Adaptation Rules (Auto-Regulate Based on Daily State)

| Condition | Action | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Tired but OK** (Energy <7, Sleep >5) | Reduce volume by 1 set per exercise | 4×6-8 bench → 3×6-8 |
| **Very Tired** (Energy <6 or Sleep <5) | Do Day C instead | Switch to lighter pump work |
| **High Stress** (Stress >7) | Drop RPE to 6-7 | Reduce weight if needed |
| **Back Discomfort** (Moderate pain) | Upper body only, skip legs | Safety first |
| **Missed Session** | Do next workout in ABC sequence | No makeup needed |

## Body Recomposition Nutrition Notes

### Nutrition Requirements
- **Protein Target**: 1.8-2.2g per kg bodyweight
- **Calorie Approach**: Small deficit (10-20% below maintenance)
- **Body Recomp**: Requires calorie deficit + high protein

### Training Emphasis
1. **Progressive overload is KEY** - must get stronger to build muscle
2. **RPE 7-8 is sweet spot** - enough stimulus without excessive fatigue
3. **Consistency > Intensity** - 3x/week every week beats 5x/week inconsistently
4. **Leg work is critical** - biggest calorie burn and muscle mass

### Recovery Priority
1. **Sleep 7-9 hours** for fat loss + muscle retention
2. **Manage stress** - high cortisol kills body recomp
3. **Don't add extra cardio** unless recovery is good

---

## Key Principles Summary

### ⏱️ Time Management
- 60 min total gym time (20-30 min cardio + 30-35 min lifting)
- Pre-workout cardio = extended warmup (doesn't fatigue muscles)
- Reduced rest periods + strategic supersets save 6-7 minutes per workout

### 🎯 RPE Philosophy
- **RPE 8 = IDEAL** (1.1x XP bonus)
- **RPE 7 = GOOD** (1.05x XP bonus)
- **RPE 9+ = PENALIZED** (0.95x XP) - avoid overtraining in calorie deficit

### 💪 Form Excellence
- **Form 9-10/10 = 1.15x XP** (critical for muscle retention during fat loss)
- **Form <7/10 = 0.75x XP** (injury risk in calorie deficit)

### 🔁 Progression
- Add reps before adding weight (double progression method)
- Progress only when form, recovery, and RPE targets are met
- Deload every 6 weeks (60% volume, 85% weight)

### 🛡️ Back Safety
- All exercises protect lower back (no spinal loading)
- Never push through back pain - modify or skip
- Upper back health exercises (Face Pulls) included

### 🎮 Consistency Rewards
- 750 XP for completing 3 sessions per week
- 2000 XP for 4 consecutive weeks of consistency
- 300 XP for cardio on all training days
