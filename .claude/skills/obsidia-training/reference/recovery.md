# Recovery Protocols & Guidelines

Recovery is where adaptation happens. Training creates the stimulus, recovery builds the muscle and strength.

## Core Recovery Pillars

### 1. Sleep (Most Important)
**Target:** 7-9 hours per night

**Why It Matters:**
- Growth hormone released during deep sleep
- Muscle protein synthesis peaks during sleep
- CNS recovery requires quality sleep
- Poor sleep = reduced performance + injury risk

**Optimization:**
- Consistent sleep/wake times (even weekends)
- Dark, cool room (18-20°C ideal)
- No screens 1hr before bed
- Avoid caffeine after 2pm
- Consider magnesium supplement

**Impact on Training:**
```
Sleep <6 hrs:  → Recovery session or rest
Sleep 6-7 hrs: → Reduce volume 10-20%
Sleep 7-9 hrs: → Train as planned
```

### 2. Nutrition
**Protein Target:** 1.6-2.2g per kg bodyweight per day

**Timing:**
- **Post-workout (0-2 hours):** 30-40g protein + carbs
- **Throughout day:** Protein every 3-4 hours
- **Pre-bed:** Casein or slow-digesting protein

**Hydration:**
- Minimum 3L water per day
- More on training days (+500-1000ml)
- Electrolytes if sweating heavily

**Carbohydrates:**
- **Training days:** 3-5g per kg bodyweight
- **Rest days:** 2-3g per kg bodyweight
- Prioritize around workouts (before/after)

**Example Daily Nutrition:**
```
Bodyweight: 80kg
Protein: 160g (2g/kg)
Carbs (training day): 320g (4g/kg)
Post-workout: 40g protein + 60g carbs within 1hr
```

### 3. Active Recovery
**Purpose:** Increase blood flow without adding stress

**Activities:**
- Light walking 20-30 min
- Swimming (easy pace)
- Cycling (conversational pace)
- Yoga/stretching 15-20 min

**When:**
- Rest days
- After very hard sessions
- During deload weeks

**DON'T:**
- Go to muscular failure
- Elevate heart rate significantly
- Add volume to training

### 4. Passive Recovery Techniques

#### Foam Rolling (10-15 min)
**Focus Areas:**
- Quads, hamstrings, glutes, lats, thoracic spine
- Spend 60-90 sec per muscle group
- Slow, controlled movements
- Pain level: Uncomfortable but not excruciating (6-7/10)

#### Stretching (15-20 min)
**Types:**
- **Static:** Hold 30-60 sec, post-workout or rest days
- **Dynamic:** Before workouts (leg swings, arm circles)
- **PNF:** Contract-relax technique for deep stretches

**Priority Areas:**
- Hip flexors (tight from sitting)
- Hamstrings
- Chest/shoulders (tight from pressing)
- Thoracic spine

#### Mobility Drills
**Daily routine (10 min):**
- Cat-cow (thoracic mobility)
- 90/90 hip stretches
- Shoulder dislocations with band
- Ankle circles
- Deep bodyweight squat hold

#### Cold/Heat Therapy
**Ice (0-48 hrs post-injury):**
- Reduce inflammation
- Acute pain/swelling
- 15-20 min maximum

**Heat (chronic tightness):**
- Increase blood flow
- Muscle relaxation
- Before stretching or workouts

**Contrast showers:**
- 2 min hot, 30 sec cold, repeat 3-4x
- Finish with cold
- Improves circulation

#### Massage
**Benefits:**
- Reduces muscle tension
- Improves ROM
- Psychological relaxation

**Frequency:**
- Professional: Monthly if affordable
- Self-massage: 2-3x per week with lacrosse ball/roller

## Training Week Structure

### 4x Per Week (Upper/Lower)
```
Monday:    Upper Push (Heavy)
Tuesday:   Lower Push (Heavy)
Wednesday: Rest / Active Recovery
Thursday:  Upper Pull (Heavy)
Friday:    Rest / Active Recovery
Saturday:  Lower Pull (Moderate)
Sunday:    Rest
```

### Recovery Days Per Body Region
**Muscle Group Minimum Rest:**
- Chest: 48 hours
- Back: 48 hours
- Legs: 48-72 hours
- Shoulders: 48 hours
- Arms: 24-48 hours

**Guideline:** Don't train same muscle group hard 2 days in a row

## Monitoring Recovery

### Daily Readiness Assessment
Track in daily note:
```
Energy:  /10 (how you feel waking up)
Sleep:   /10 (quality + duration)
Soreness: None | Mild | Moderate | Severe
Mood:    /10 (psychological readiness)
Stress:  /10 (life/work stress)
```

### HRV (Heart Rate Variability) - Advanced
**What:** Measure of autonomic nervous system recovery
**How:** HRV app + chest strap, measure upon waking
**Interpretation:**
- HRV high = recovered, train hard
- HRV low = still fatigued, reduce intensity

### Performance Indicators
**Red Flags:**
- Strength drop >10% on first set
- RPE feels 2+ points higher than normal
- Motivation completely absent
- Persistent muscle soreness 3+ days

**Green Lights:**
- Energy 7+/10
- Sleep 7+/10
- Minimal soreness
- Motivated to train

## Deload Protocols

### When to Deload
**Scheduled:** Every 6 weeks (planned)
**Unplanned:** When 3+ red flags present

### Deload Methods

#### 1. Volume Deload (Recommended)
**Reduce sets by 40-50%, keep intensity:**
```
Normal: Squat 4x8 @ 100kg
Deload: Squat 2x8 @ 100kg
```

#### 2. Intensity Deload
**Reduce weight by 30-40%, keep volume:**
```
Normal: Squat 4x8 @ 100kg
Deload: Squat 4x8 @ 60-70kg
```

#### 3. Full Deload (High Fatigue)
**Reduce both volume and intensity:**
```
Normal: Squat 4x8 @ 100kg
Deload: Squat 2x8 @ 70kg
```

### Deload Week Structure
```
Monday:    Upper Push (50% volume, same weight)
Tuesday:   Active recovery
Wednesday: Lower Push (50% volume, same weight)
Thursday:  Active recovery
Friday:    Upper Pull (50% volume, same weight)
Saturday:  Active recovery or complete rest
Sunday:    Rest
```

**Goals:**
- Maintain movement patterns
- Reduce accumulated fatigue
- Preserve strength
- Return refreshed

## Injury Prevention

### Pre-Workout
1. **General Warm-up (5 min):**
   - Light cardio (bike, row, jump rope)
   - Raise body temperature
   - Increase heart rate

2. **Specific Warm-up (5-10 min):**
   - Movement prep for session
   - Example (before squats):
     - Bodyweight squats x10
     - Leg swings x10 each direction
     - Hip circles x10 each direction
     - Empty bar squats x10
     - 50% weight x5
     - 75% weight x3
     - Working weight

3. **Activation (optional):**
   - Glute bridges before squats
   - Band pull-aparts before pressing
   - Face pulls before pulling

### During Workout
**Form Over Everything:**
- Don't chase weight at expense of form
- Film sets if form uncertain
- Stop set if technique breaks down

**Listen to Pain:**
- Discomfort/burn in muscle = OK
- Joint pain = STOP
- Sharp pain = STOP IMMEDIATELY

**Auto-Regulate:**
- Feeling off? Reduce weight/volume
- Good day? Push RPE 8, not 9
- Bad day? Recovery session

### Post-Workout
1. **Cool-down (5 min):**
   - Light cardio to gradually lower heart rate
   - Begin recovery process

2. **Static stretching (10 min):**
   - Focus on muscles worked
   - Hold 30-60 sec per stretch
   - Improve flexibility

3. **Nutrition (within 2 hours):**
   - Protein + carbs meal
   - Hydration
   - Electrolytes if heavy sweating

## Recovery Supplements (Evidence-Based)

### Tier 1 (Strong Evidence)
- **Protein powder:** Convenient, meet daily target
- **Creatine monohydrate:** 5g/day, strength + recovery
- **Caffeine:** Pre-workout, 3-6mg per kg bodyweight

### Tier 2 (Moderate Evidence)
- **Omega-3 (Fish oil):** Reduce inflammation, 2-3g/day
- **Vitamin D:** If deficient, 2000-5000 IU/day
- **Magnesium:** Sleep quality, muscle function, 300-400mg/day

### Tier 3 (Emerging Evidence)
- **Tart cherry juice:** Reduce soreness, anti-inflammatory
- **BCAAs:** If training fasted, otherwise get from protein
- **Electrolytes:** If heavy sweating or keto diet

### ❌ Not Worth It:
- Most "recovery" proprietary blends
- Majority of pre-workout ingredients besides caffeine
- Testosterone boosters (unless prescribed)

## Stress Management

**Why It Matters:**
- Cortisol (stress hormone) inhibits recovery
- Disrupts sleep quality
- Reduces testosterone
- Impacts motivation + performance

**Techniques:**
1. **Meditation:** 10 min daily, use app (Headspace, Calm)
2. **Deep breathing:** 4-7-8 technique before bed
3. **Nature walks:** 20-30 min outdoors
4. **Journaling:** Evening brain dump
5. **Time management:** Don't overcommit

**Remember:** You don't build muscle in the gym. You build it in recovery. Training is the stimulus, but recovery is where the adaptation actually happens. Prioritize it accordingly.
