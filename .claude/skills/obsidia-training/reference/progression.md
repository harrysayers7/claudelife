# Progressive Overload Principles

Progressive overload is the systematic increase in training stimulus over time to drive continuous adaptation and strength/muscle gains.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Volume Overload** (Primary driver for hypertrophy)
**Definition:** Total sets × reps × weight

**Implementation:**
- **Add sets**: Increase from 3 to 4 sets per exercise
- **Add reps**: Progress from 8 reps to 10 reps within target range
- **Add exercises**: Include additional movements for lagging body parts

**Guidelines:**
- Increase volume by max 10% per week
- Deload every 6 weeks (reduce volume by 40%)
- Monitor recovery - volume drives growth but requires recovery

**Example:**
```
Week 1: Bench Press 3x8 @ 80kg = 1,920kg total volume
Week 2: Bench Press 3x9 @ 80kg = 2,160kg (+12.5% - too much)
Better: Bench Press 3x8 @ 82.5kg = 1,980kg (+3.1%)
```

### 2. **Intensity Overload** (Primary driver for strength)
**Definition:** Percentage of 1-rep max or load used

**Implementation:**
- **Add weight**: Increase load when hit top of rep range at target RPE
- **Increase RPE**: Move from RPE 7 to RPE 8 with same weight
- **Reduce rest**: Less rest between sets increases metabolic stress

**Guidelines:**
- For primary lifts: Add 2.5-5kg when hit 4x10 at RPE 8
- For accessories: Add 1-2 reps before increasing weight
- Don't chase weight at expense of form

**Example:**
```
Target: 4 sets of 8-10 reps at RPE 8
Week 1: 4x8 @ 100kg (RPE 8) ✓
Week 2: 4x9 @ 100kg (RPE 8) ✓
Week 3: 4x10 @ 100kg (RPE 8) ✓
Week 4: 4x8 @ 102.5kg (RPE 8) ← Progression
```

### 3. **Frequency Overload**
**Definition:** Training muscle groups/movements more often

**Implementation:**
- **Increase sessions**: Move from 3x/week to 4x/week
- **Hit muscles twice**: Upper/Lower split (each muscle 2x/week)
- **Daily undulating**: Vary intensity across sessions

**Guidelines:**
- Most effective for intermediate+ lifters
- Requires good recovery (sleep, nutrition)
- Monitor for overtraining signs

### 4. **Density Overload**
**Definition:** More work in same or less time

**Implementation:**
- **Reduce rest periods**: 3 min → 2.5 min → 2 min
- **Supersets**: Pair non-competing exercises
- **Circuits**: Multiple exercises with minimal rest

**Caution:**
- Don't sacrifice intensity for density
- Maintain form quality
- Best for hypertrophy, not maximal strength

## Movement-Specific Strategies

### Compound Lifts (Squat, Deadlift, Bench, OHP, Rows)
**Primary Method:** Linear progression with weight
**Target:** Add 2.5-5kg every 1-2 weeks
**Rep Range:** 5-10 reps
**RPE Target:** 8 (2 reps in reserve)

**Progression Example:**
```
Week 1-2: 4x6 @ 100kg
Week 3-4: 4x7 @ 100kg
Week 5-6: 4x8 @ 100kg
Week 7: Deload (3x6 @ 80kg)
Week 8: 4x6 @ 105kg ← New cycle
```

### Accessory Movements (Curls, Lateral Raises, Leg Curls)
**Primary Method:** Rep progression then weight
**Target:** Add 1-2 reps per week, then increase weight
**Rep Range:** 10-20 reps
**RPE Target:** 7-8

**Progression Example:**
```
Week 1: 3x10 @ 12.5kg
Week 2: 3x11 @ 12.5kg
Week 3: 3x12 @ 12.5kg
Week 4: 3x10 @ 15kg ← Weight increase, reps reset
```

## RPE-Based Auto-Regulation

**What is RPE?**
- Rate of Perceived Exertion (1-10 scale)
- Based on reps in reserve (RIR)

**RPE Scale:**
```
RPE 10 = Absolute max, no reps left (RIR 0)
RPE 9  = 1 rep left (RIR 1)
RPE 8  = 2 reps left (RIR 2) ← Sweet spot
RPE 7  = 3 reps left (RIR 3)
RPE 6  = 4+ reps left (RIR 4+)
```

**Using RPE for Progression:**
1. **Consistent RPE, add reps:**
   - If sets consistently feel RPE 7, add 1 rep next week
   - Gradually push to RPE 8 before adding weight

2. **Consistent RPE, add weight:**
   - If hitting top of rep range at RPE 8, add weight
   - Accept drop in reps (e.g., 4x10 → 4x8 with more weight)

3. **Variable RPE = back off:**
   - If RPE jumps from 8 to 9+ mid-session, fatigue is high
   - Reduce weight or reps for remaining sets

## Periodization Models

### Linear Periodization (Beginner-Friendly)
**Structure:** Progressive increase over time
**Timeline:** 4-8 week blocks

**Example:**
```
Weeks 1-2: 4x10 @ 70% (hypertrophy focus)
Weeks 3-4: 4x8 @ 75%
Weeks 5-6: 4x6 @ 80% (strength focus)
Week 7: Deload (3x8 @ 60%)
Week 8: Test new maxes
```

### Daily Undulating (Intermediate+)
**Structure:** Vary rep ranges within same week
**Timeline:** Ongoing

**Example:**
```
Monday: Squat 4x6 (heavy)
Thursday: Squat 3x12 (volume)
```

### Block Periodization (Advanced)
**Structure:** Dedicated phases for specific adaptations
**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks per block

**Example:**
```
Block 1: Hypertrophy (4x12 @ RPE 8)
Block 2: Strength (4x5 @ RPE 9)
Block 3: Power/Peaking (5x3 @ RPE 9.5)
```

## Tracking Progression

### What to Track:
1. **Volume:** Total kg lifted per session/week
2. **Intensity:** Average weight used or RPE
3. **Performance:** Reps/weight on key exercises
4. **Recovery:** Sleep, energy, soreness

### When to Progress:
✅ **Progress when:**
- All sets hit target reps at target RPE
- Form quality remains 8+/10
- Recovery is adequate (energy 7+/10, sleep 7+/10)
- No pain/injury present

❌ **Don't progress when:**
- Form breaks down
- RPE exceeds target by 2+ points
- Experiencing pain or injury
- Recovery is compromised (sick, stressed, poor sleep)

## Plateau Busting

### If Stalled on a Lift:

**1. Check Form First**
- Video your sets
- Compare to reference videos
- Address weak points

**2. Increase Volume**
- Add 1-2 sets per week
- Add variation (incline bench if flat bench stalled)

**3. Increase Frequency**
- Train lift 2x per week instead of 1x
- One heavy session, one volume session

**4. Deload**
- Take 50% volume/intensity for 1 week
- Often breaks plateaus via recovery

**5. Change Stimulus**
- Swap rep ranges (8-10 → 6-8)
- Change exercise variation
- Adjust tempo (slow eccentrics)

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Too Much, Too Soon
**Problem:** Adding 10kg to squat every week
**Solution:** 2.5-5kg increments, patience

### ❌ Chasing Weight Over Form
**Problem:** Ego lifting, form breaks down
**Solution:** RPE 8 max, film sets, focus on quality

### ❌ No Deloads
**Problem:** Training hard 12+ weeks straight
**Solution:** Deload every 6 weeks (40% volume reduction)

### ❌ Ignoring Recovery
**Problem:** Poor sleep, high stress, low energy - still adding weight
**Solution:** Auto-regulate based on daily readiness

### ❌ Same Exercises Forever
**Problem:** Body adapts, progress stalls
**Solution:** Rotate accessories every 4-6 weeks

## Progressive Overload Checklist

Before adding weight/volume, verify:
- [ ] Hit target reps on all sets for 2+ sessions
- [ ] RPE at or below target (not exceeding)
- [ ] Form quality 8+/10 on all sets
- [ ] Energy/sleep adequate (7+/10)
- [ ] No pain or injury present
- [ ] Last deload was <6 weeks ago

If all checked ✓ → Progress!
If any ✗ → Hold or reduce load

---

**Remember:** Progressive overload is cumulative. Small, consistent increases (1-5% per week) compound to massive gains over months and years. Patience and consistency beat aggression every time.
