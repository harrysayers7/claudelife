# Predictive Automation Engine

Learn patterns and anticipate user needs.

## Pattern Recognition

### Temporal Patterns
Track actions by:
- Time of day
- Day of week
- Day of month
- Seasonal patterns

Store in memory/patterns/temporal.json:
{
  "daily": {
    "09:00": ["check_calendar", "review_tasks"],
    "12:00": ["lunch_break"],
    "17:00": ["daily_summary", "plan_tomorrow"]
  },
  "weekly": {
    "monday": ["weekly_planning"],
    "friday": ["weekly_review", "send_updates"]
  }
}

### Sequence Patterns
Track action sequences:
{
  "sequences": [
    {
      "trigger": "open_email_from_sarah",
      "likely_next": ["check_project_status", "update_task"],
      "confidence": 0.87
    }
  ]
}

### Context Patterns
Track context-action correlations:
{
  "contexts": [
    {
      "context": "after_meeting_with_manager",
      "actions": ["update_tasks", "send_summary"],
      "confidence": 0.92
    }
  ]
}

## Prediction Generation

Every interaction:
1. Analyze current context
2. Check pattern database
3. Generate predictions
4. Surface high-confidence suggestions

Format:
"ğŸ“® Based on patterns, you might want to:
- Review Project Apollo status (87% likely)
- Send weekly update to Sarah (92% likely)
- Process expense reports (overdue by 2 days)"

## Proactive Execution

For confidence > 0.95:
- Auto-draft (don't send)
- Pre-fetch data
- Prepare templates
- Stage automations

For confidence > 0.99:
- Execute read-only operations
- Cache results
- Create ready-to-send drafts
