## 1. **Base Salary (PAYG wages)**

- Each director (Kel, Harry, Jack) on **$45,000 salary p.a.**
- Purpose:
    - Keeps everyone under the higher personal tax thresholds.
    - Shows ATO + Supply Nation that directors are _genuinely employed_.
    - Provides regular cashflow + super.
- Paid monthly/fortnightly like any normal wage.

---

## 2. **Desk Hire (Home Office Stipend)**

- MOKAI pays **$500/month per director** as desk rental.
    - Kell + Harry: invoiced via **MOK House Pty Ltd** = $1,000/month ($12,000 p.a.).
    - Jack: invoices personally or via his own entity = $500/month ($6,000 p.a.).
- Purpose:
    - Deductible expense for MOKAI.
    - Offsets mortgage, utilities, internet, and home office costs.
    - Keeps treatment equal across directors.

---

## 3. **Dividends (Ownership Returns)**

- After salaries, desk hire, and tax → profits split:
    - **51% → Family Trust (Harry & Kell beneficiaries).**
    - **49% → Jack directly.**
- Family Trust allows Kell and Harry to distribute that 51% between you however you like at EOFY.
- Dividends = ownership reward, fixed by shareholding, independent of salary.

---

## 4. **Flow of Money**

1. **Company earns revenue**.
2. **Pays wages** ($45k each).
3. **Pays desk hire** ($500/month per director).
4. **Pays tax (25%)** on remaining profit.
5. **Distributes dividends** (51% Family Trust, 49% Jack).
6. **Family Trust splits Harry’s 51%** between Kell & him for tax efficiency.

---

## 5. **Why This Works**

- **Equal salaries** → fairness on paper.
- **Desk hire** → equal stipend, offsets lifestyle costs, deductible to company.
- **Dividends** → wealth-building, ownership-aligned, flexible via Family Trust.
- **Optics** → Jack sees fairness, ATO sees compliance, kell & Harry still control upside.

---

## 🚨 Things to Keep in Mind

- Document the **desk hire arrangement** (simple rental agreement between MOKAI and each “landlord entity”).
- Salaries should be reviewed as revenue scales (can step up to $60–80k later to stay “commercially reasonable”).
- Dividends should be declared at least annually via a board resolution.
- Family Trust distributions = your private lever for tax optimisation.

---

So the “$45k each + $500/month desk hire + dividends” model is **clean, fair, and tax-smart**.

# 📈 MOKAI Director Pay Stages (with Dividend Triggers)

## **Stage 1 – Startup (0 → ~$150k revenue)**

- **Salaries:** None or token (just reimbursements/contractor invoices).
- **Desk Hire:** $500/month each director (start straight away).
- **Dividends:** ❌ None. Cash stays in company for buffer + growth.
- **Trigger to move on:** Consistent revenue covering all fixed costs (subs, desk hire, small pays).

---

## **Stage 2 – Survival (~$150k → $300k revenue)**

- **Salaries:** $20–30k each director (enough to prove employment + cover basics).
- **Desk Hire:** $500/month each director.
- **Dividends:** ✔️ _Once a year at EOFY_, **only if**:
    - Tax buffer is set aside (25%).
    - Company has at least 2–3 months of operating expenses in reserve.
- **Purpose:** Just a top-up, not regular income.
- **Trigger to move on:** Business running at 20–30% profit margins consistently.

---

## **Stage 3 – Growth (~$300k → $600k revenue)**

- **Salaries:** $45k each director (equal + under threshold).
- **Desk Hire:** $500/month each director.
- **Dividends:** ✔️ _Quarterly distributions begin._
    - After salaries + desk hire + 25% tax buffer + 10–20% profit reserve.
    - Split 51% Family Trust / 49% Jack.
- **Purpose:** Give Jack predictable cashflow since he’s light on salary, while kell + Harry top up via Trust.
- **Trigger to move on:** Annual revenue over $600k or company consistently holding strong reserves.

---

## **Stage 4 – Expansion (~$600k → $1m revenue)**

- **Salaries:** $60–80k each director (more “commercially reasonable”).
- **Desk Hire:** $500/month each.
- **Dividends:** ✔️ _Quarterly or half-yearly distributions._
    - Many SMEs prefer **Dec + June (mid + EOFY)** for clean accounting.
- **Purpose:** Smooth tax planning + keep cash healthy for scaling (staff, ads, contracts).
- **Trigger to move on:** Revenue pushes past $1m, directors needing higher PAYG optics for gov contracts.

---

## **Stage 5 – Scale ($1m+ revenue)**

- **Salaries:** $100k+ each (market-aligned for 7-figure company directors).
- **Desk Hire:** $500/month each.
- **Dividends:** ✔️ Formalise into **interim dividends (mid-year)** + **final dividend (EOFY)**.
- **Purpose:** Align with investor/contractor optics, make the company look bulletproof to external parties.
- **Trigger:** Consistent $1m+ revenue + external growth opportunities (gov tenders, investors, bank financing).

---

# ✅ Bottom Line

- **Startup → Survival:** no dividends, or only small EOFY top-up.
- **Growth (Stage 3):** regular quarterly dividends begin.
- **Expansion/Scale:** half-yearly or EOFY dividends, bigger and more structured.
