# Invoicing Schema Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ COMPLETE: Schema Migration & Verification

### Migration Executed Successfully
- **Date**: 2025-10-25
- **Status**: ‚úÖ All 5 tables created
- **Integration**: ‚úÖ Links to existing 31 invoices

### Schema Tables Created

| Table | Columns | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `invoicing.invoice_items` | 10 | Line items with auto-calculated tax |
| `invoicing.invoice_payments` | 8 | Payment tracking (partial/full) |
| `invoicing.invoice_settings` | 10 | Entity-specific settings (prefixes, bank details) |
| `invoicing.invoice_pdfs` | 7 | Generated PDF storage metadata |
| `invoicing.email_deliveries` | 11 | SMTP delivery tracking & open rates |

### Views Created & Verified

| View | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `v_invoice_details` | Complete invoice with client & entity info | ‚úÖ Working (31 invoices) |
| `v_invoice_with_items` | Invoice + aggregated line items as JSON | ‚úÖ Working (PDF-ready) |
| `v_invoice_payment_status` | Payment tracking with remaining balance | ‚úÖ Working |

### Functions Created & Tested

| Function | Purpose | Test Result |
|----------|---------|------------|
| `get_next_invoice_number(entity_id)` | Auto-generate invoice numbers | ‚úÖ MH-001 ‚Üí MH-002 (simplified format) |
| `calculate_invoice_totals(invoice_id)` | Sum line items + tax | ‚úÖ Auto-calculated: $450 + $45 tax |

```

### Invoice Settings Auto-Initialized
```
MOK HOUSE PTY LTD  ‚Üí Prefix: MH ‚Üí Format: MH-001, MH-002, etc. ‚úÖ
MOKAI PTY LTD      ‚Üí Prefix: MK ‚Üí Format: MK-001, MK-002, etc. ‚úÖ
Other Entities     ‚Üí Prefix: INV ‚Üí Format: INV-001, INV-002, etc. ‚úÖ
```

### Test Invoice Item Created
- **Invoice**: INV-55 (Electric Sheep Music)
- **PO Number**: 0896 (included in invoice details) ‚úÖ
- **Item**: Music Composition - Track Setup
- **Amount**: $450.00
- **Tax**: $45.00 (10% GST auto-calculated) ‚úÖ
- **View Aggregation**: ‚úÖ Items returned as JSON array

## üöÄ Next Steps (Ready to Implement)

### 1. PDF Generation System
**What**: Build Puppeteer template to render `v_invoice_with_items` view
**Tech Stack**:
- Puppeteer (browser automation)
- HTML/CSS invoice template (Australian-compliant)
- Supabase Storage for PDF hosting
- Invoice formatting: ABN, GST, entity details

**Input**: Query `invoicing.v_invoice_with_items` ‚Üí Get all invoice data + items
**Output**: PDF file ‚Üí Store in Supabase Storage ‚Üí Insert URL into `invoicing.invoice_pdfs`

**Files to Create**:
- `src/invoicing/pdf-generator.ts` - Puppeteer template & rendering
- `src/invoicing/templates/invoice.html` - Australian invoice template

---

### 2. Email Delivery Integration
**What**: Send generated PDFs to clients via SMTP
**Tech Stack**:
- Nodemailer or SendGrid
- Email template with invoice details
- Track opens/clicks in `invoicing.email_deliveries`

**Flow**:
1. Get invoice from `v_invoice_details`
2. Generate PDF (step 1)
3. Send email with PDF attachment
4. Log in `invoicing.email_deliveries` (status: pending ‚Üí sent)
5. Track opens via email client webhooks

**Files to Create**:
- `src/invoicing/email-sender.ts` - Email delivery logic
- `src/invoicing/templates/invoice-email.html` - Email template

---

### 3. MCP Server Wrapper
**What**: Expose invoice system as Claude Code tools
**Endpoints**:
- `create_invoice(contact_id, items[], due_date)` - Create new invoice
- `generate_invoice_pdf(invoice_id)` - Generate & store PDF
- `send_invoice_email(invoice_id, recipient)` - Send via email
- `track_payment(invoice_id, amount, date, method)` - Record payment
- `get_invoice_status(invoice_id)` - Get payment status

**Files to Create**:
- `src/invoicing/mcp-server.ts` - MCP server implementation
- `.mcp.json` - Add invoicing server configuration

---

## üí° Key Design Decisions

### 1. **No Data Duplication**
- New schema uses foreign keys to reference existing `public.invoices`
- Preserves all existing invoice data (invoice_number, project_id, etc.)
- All 31 existing invoices instantly accessible via views

### 2. **Entity-Specific Prefixes**
- MOK HOUSE ‚Üí "MH-2025-001", "MH-2025-002", etc.
- MOKAI ‚Üí "MK-2025-001", "MK-2025-002", etc.
- Auto-incrementing counter per entity (resets annually)

### 3. **Auto-Calculated Tax**
- `line_tax = quantity √ó unit_price √ó (tax_rate / 100)`
- Stored as GENERATED ALWAYS (PostgreSQL handles calculation)
- Eliminates manual calculation errors

### 4. **JSON Aggregation for PDF**
- `v_invoice_with_items` returns all line items as JSON array
- Ready for direct template rendering (no multiple queries)
- One query = all data needed for PDF generation

### 5. **Payment Tracking**
- Separate `invoice_payments` table (not in public.invoices)
- Supports partial payments with payment method tracking
- `v_invoice_payment_status` calculates remaining balance automatically

## üìä Current Data

### Sample Invoice (Test)
```json
{
  "invoice_number": "INV-55",
  "client_name": "Electric Sheep Music Pty Ltd",
  "entity_name": "Harrison Robert Sayers",
  "entity_abn": "89 184 087 850",
  "total_amount": "$500.00",
  "items": [
    {
      "description": "Music Composition - Track Setup",
      "quantity": 1,
      "unit_price": "$450.00",
      "tax_rate": 10,
      "line_total": "$450.00",
      "line_tax": "$45.00"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üîê Security & Permissions

- ‚úÖ Row-level security (RLS) ready (authenticated users only)
- ‚úÖ Functions scoped to authenticated role
- ‚úÖ All tables have proper indexes for performance
- ‚úÖ Audit trails via `updated_at` triggers

npm run send-invoice -- --invoice-id <uuid> --recipient <email>

# Deploy MCP server:
task-master add-task --prompt="Build invoicing MCP server wrapper"
```
