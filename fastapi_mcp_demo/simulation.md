# Live Simulation: FastAPI-MCP in Action

## Scenario: MOKAI Business Operations

### Current Situation:
You're running MOKAI and need to:
1. Check if a new vendor meets IRAP compliance requirements
2. Find relevant government tenders
3. Check on a client project status

## WITHOUT FastAPI-MCP (How it works today):

**You would need to:**
```bash
# 1. Manually check compliance
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/compliance/check \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"vendor_abn": "87654321098", "framework": "IRAP"}'

# 2. Manually search tenders
curl "http://localhost:8001/tenders/search?keywords=cybersecurity&max_value=750000"

# 3. Manually check client status
curl "http://localhost:8001/client/DEPT-001/status"
```

## WITH FastAPI-MCP (After restart - what will happen):

**You can simply ask Claude Code:**

> "I'm evaluating vendor ABN 87654321098 for an IRAP project. Check their compliance and find relevant cybersecurity tenders under $750k."

**Claude Code will automatically:**
1. Call `check_vendor_compliance(vendor_abn="87654321098", framework="IRAP")`
2. Call `search_government_tenders(keywords="cybersecurity", max_value=750000)`
3. Analyze results and provide business recommendations

## Let me simulate what the responses would be:

### 1. Compliance Check Response:
```json
{
  "vendor_abn": "87654321098",
  "framework": "IRAP",
  "status": "compliant",
  "score": 88,
  "details": {
    "last_assessment": "2024-01-15",
    "certifications": ["ISO27001", "SOC2"],
    "risk_level": "low"
  }
}
```

### 2. Tender Search Response:
```json
{
  "query": "cybersecurity",
  "max_value": 750000,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "ATM001",
      "title": "Cybersecurity Assessment Services - cybersecurity",
      "agency": "Department of Defence",
      "value": 750000,
      "deadline": "2024-02-15",
      "requirements": ["IRAP assessment", "Security clearance"]
    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

**Claude Code's Intelligent Response:**
> "Great news! Vendor 87654321098 is IRAP compliant with a strong score of 88/100 and low risk level. I found 1 relevant tender from Department of Defence worth $750k for cybersecurity assessment services, deadline Feb 15. Since this vendor meets IRAP requirements and you have the necessary certifications, this looks like a good opportunity for MOKAI."

## Real Business Value:

Instead of 3 manual API calls + analysis, you get:
- **One natural language request**
- **Automatic data gathering**
- **Intelligent analysis and recommendations**
- **Business context awareness**

This transforms your FastAPI business logic into an AI-powered business assistant!
