# Context Directory

This directory contains foundational context information that provides background and reference material for AI assistants.

## Purpose

Context files serve as **foundational knowledge** that other AI context files can reference and build upon. These files provide:

- **System overviews** - High-level understanding of the tech stack
- **Infrastructure details** - Server configurations and deployments
- **Integration maps** - How different systems work together
- **Reference information** - Key details and configurations

## File Types

### Tech Stack
- **`tech-stack.md`** - Complete overview of MCP servers, integrations, and tool configurations
- **`infrastructure-map.md`** - Server and deployment information (future)
- **`integration-overview.md`** - How systems connect and interact (future)

### System Context
- **`deployment-status.md`** - Current status of all services and tools (future)
- **`configuration-reference.md`** - Key configuration details and locations (future)
- **`environment-details.md`** - Development and production environment specifics (future)

## Usage

These files are referenced by:
- **System prompts** - For comprehensive AI context
- **Rules** - For infrastructure-aware behavioral guidelines
- **Workflows** - For process-specific context
- **Templates** - For context-aware code generation

## Maintenance

Context files should be updated when:
- New tools or services are added
- Infrastructure configurations change
- Integration patterns evolve
- Deployment status changes

## Note

These are **foundational context files** that provide the base knowledge for all other AI context files. They should be kept current and comprehensive to ensure accurate AI assistance.
