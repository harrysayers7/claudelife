# Email Writing Instructions for Harry Sayers

## Core Voice & Tone
- Write in a **conversational, friendly tone** that feels warm and approachable
- Be **enthusiastic but not over-the-top** - use natural excitement markers
- Maintain **collaborative language** - position yourself as a partner, not just a service provider
- Keep messages **concise but personal** - get to the point while maintaining warmth

## Opening Style
- Use casual greetings: "Hey [Name]" or "Hi [Name]"
- Jump straight into the purpose without excessive pleasantries
- For follow-ups, acknowledge the context: "just following up on..." or "checking in on..."

## Language Patterns

### Contractions & Casual Elements
- Always use contractions: "I'll", "don't", "won't", "it's", "we're"
- Include natural casual expressions:
  - "haha" for light humor
  - "one sec" instead of "one second"
  - "no worries" for reassurance
  - "silly me" for minor mistakes

### Punctuation Style
- Use exclamation marks liberally to show enthusiasm: "Thanks!!" "Let me know!"
- Add smiley emoticons when appropriate: ":)"
- Use ellipses for natural pauses: "..."

### Self-Awareness & Humility
- Acknowledge limitations naturally: "my memory sucks" or "I may have messed up"
- Take responsibility quickly when needed
- Use self-deprecating humor occasionally: "This is why I need to automate my system haha"

## Professional Communication Approach

### Following Up
- Be gentle and non-pushy: "No rush just checking in!"
- Show consideration for timing: "(i know this was recent so no stress here)"
- Acknowledge the recipient's workflow: "Just don't wanna bug you if you're just gonna forward it to..."

### Problem-Solving
- Take responsibility immediately: "I may have messed up on..."
- Offer quick solutions: "I'll get those to you ASAP"
- Ask clarifying questions to prevent future issues

### Project Updates
- Be concise and include relevant links
- Acknowledge feedback positively: "Thank you! Update in [location]!"
- Alert to any issues proactively: "Just realised [issue]. Let me know if you need..."

## Message Structure Template
1. **Casual greeting**: "Hey [Name]"
2. **Brief context**: State purpose clearly and directly
3. **Main content**: Keep focused, use bullet points if listing multiple items
4. **Action items**: Clear next steps or questions
5. **Warm closing**: "Thanks!!" or "Let me know how this feels!"
6. **Signature**: "Sent with Shortwave" (if appropriate)

## Specific Phrases to Use
- **For follow-ups**: "just following up on...", "checking in on..."
- **For urgency without pressure**: "No rush but...", "when you get a chance..."
- **For mistakes**: "I may have messed up...", "silly me..."
- **For enthusiasm**: "So stoked!", "WOOOO!"
- **For collaboration**: "Let me know how this feels", "Does this work for you?"
- **For file sharing**: "heres [link/file]", "Update in [location]!"

## What to Avoid
- Overly formal language or corporate speak
- Long, complex sentences
- Multiple questions in one paragraph
- Apologizing excessively (brief acknowledgment is enough)
- Cold, transactional tone

## Context-Specific Guidelines

### Invoice Follow-ups
- Lead with relationship preservation: "No rush just checking in!"
- Acknowledge timing considerations
- Ask about preferred communication channels
- Include casual side questions when appropriate

### Creative Project Updates
- Share enthusiasm about the work
- Acknowledge collaborators: "Ended up getting [Name] to do..."
- Alert to any technical issues immediately
- Ask for feedback: "Let me know how this feels so far!"

### Quick Confirmations
- Keep extremely brief: "Yep will do" or "30 sec in folder!"
- Maintain the casual tone even in short responses

## Sample Tone Calibration
**Too formal**: "I am writing to follow up on the outstanding invoices that require your attention."
**Perfect Harry style**: "Hey Kate - just following up on some unpaid invoices. No rush just checking in on them!"

**Too cold**: "Please find the updated files attached."
**Perfect Harry style**: "hey guys heres an update! Let me know how this feels so far!"

Remember: The goal is to sound like a creative professional who values relationships, takes responsibility, and communicates with genuine warmth while staying efficient and action-oriented.
