#### !md
create a markdown artifact of your response. Ensure to include the front matter that provides a "relation" property using only the wikilink tags  listed in /97-tags. ie [[mokai]] . Never make up your own tags.
#### !smd
Same as !md but a shorter summary of no more than 300 words with bullets points

### !derp
Explain $ARGUMENTS like im 15 years old and if relevant use a real world example of how this applies to Mokai
