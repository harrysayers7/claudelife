## Covermore Sting Brief

**CREATIVE DIRECTION:**

Creating a sting/sonic branding for the brand Covermore that sings the brand name to use on this campaign and in the future. They are after something that really stands out and feels different in a memorable way. It's important that the sting feels very deliberate and self aware. They don't want this to feel like we've been "forced" to sing the brand name. Instead we lean into that classic feel and use what works so well as a sung sting.

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">The brief has changed a little from the Agency deck. </mark>The agency have asked us not to focus too much on matching the tone of the film and instead making sure that the sting is flexible enough to work beyond this campaign. They have also asked us to shift away from "warm, caring, simple" and focus more on <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">**"Fun, bright, modern, memorable"**</mark>


**TONE & EMOTION:**

The sting should <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">avoid overly sweet or sentimental tones to prevent feeling like a "nappy ad" </mark>and instead be fun, bright, and modern.<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;"> The sonic brand will be self-aware and possibly playful, nodding to classic 1980s </mark>Australian jingles but with a deliberate creative choice rather than a forced trope.

This sonic asset aims to support Covermore's aggressive growth plan by increasing brand memorability and visibility. The sting needs to carry different emotional weights depending on the media context.


**INSTRUMENTATION:**

Female vocals + anything else you think works


**STRUCTURE:**

Needs to be short so that it works with the 6 sec as well as the 30 sec and beyond this campaign. Flexibility in the sting's execution is critical; it must work across various formats including six- and thirty-second ads and radio spots without losing impact.


**CLIENT FEEDBACK:**

Covermore is developing a sonic branding sting that will serve as an enduring brand cue across this campaign and future marketing efforts. The client wants the sting to say the brand's three-syllable name, "Covermore," to create immediate brand recognition.

Potential exists for the sting to be used creatively within scenes, such as a character humming it, to enhance brand recall organically - however for now focus on the sting existing like a traditional sting that is played at the end of an ad.

## AI Suggestions

> [!NOTE]
> **Creative Concept:**
>
> For the Covermore sting, we need a punchy, memorable 1-2 second sonic moment that sits between nostalgic Australian jingle charm and contemporary sonic branding sophistication. The key is making "Co-ver-more" feel like a natural, catchy phrase rather than forced brand singing. Think of it as a mini-earworm that's self-aware and clever - like if Old Spice's confidence met a classic Aussie ad jingle's warmth, but kept things fresh and modern.
>
> The vocal delivery should be bright, confident, and slightly playful - maybe with a subtle smile in the voice. Rather than sweet or sentimental, aim for upbeat and assured. The three syllables need distinct, melodic separation to maximize memorability while maintaining natural flow.
>
>
> **Musical Direction:**
>
> - **Genre:** Pop/commercial jingle hybrid with modern production sheen
> - **Tempo:** Quick and energetic (feels bright but not rushed) - the sting is so short tempo is less about BPM and more about forward momentum
> - **Key Elements:**
>   - Lead female vocal with strong, clear enunciation
>   - Potential harmony stack or doubling for thickness
>   - Short melodic hook that rises slightly on each syllable
>   - Clean, punchy finish
>
>
> **Sound Design Ideas:**
>
> - **Opening:** Bright musical hit or pluck that announces the sting (maybe mallet instrument, bright synth, or even just the vocal entering confidently)
> - **Vocal Treatment:** Clean but modern - slight compression and presence, possibly a quick subtle delay tail for width
> - **Texture:** Minimal but effective - perhaps a single supporting chord underneath or a quick ascending flourish
> - **Finish:** Clean cutoff or very brief reverb tail that doesn't overstay its welcome - needs to work for 6-second ads
>
>
> **Sonic Logo/Audio Mnemonic:**
>
> The vocal melody itself becomes the mnemonic. Consider a simple three-note ascending pattern (like do-mi-sol) for "Co-ver-more" that has natural momentum and feels complete despite being ultra-brief. The pattern should be distinctive enough to be hummed or whistled. Alternative approach: slight rhythmic syncopation on the middle syllable to add personality (Co-ver-MORE with a bounce).
>
>
> **Creative Intent:**
>
> This sonic branding creates instant recognition while supporting Covermore's growth ambitions through flexible, memorable audio identity. By embracing the deliberate nature of a sung brand name rather than hiding from it, we achieve authenticity and confidence. The modern production prevents nostalgia from dating the brand, while the melodic clarity ensures it cuts through across all media formats. The sting becomes a sonic shorthand for the brand's promise - covering you completely, confidently, memorably.
