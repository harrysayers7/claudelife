## Coopers Old Mates Brief

**CREATIVE DIRECTION:**

This is the "greatest job ever" according to ES! The concept features dads who are too old to be in a band - being in a band. The characters are envisioned as musicians who started playing at ages 14-15 and maintained musical skills through occasional monthly sessions. Think garage band proficiency - not amateur but not professionally polished.

The approach mirrors the DiDi music campaign where the music doesn't lean into the comedy except for one element - in this case, the lyrics. The recording should emphasize "warts and all" character over studio polish, using drum sounds and mixing techniques that preserve live energy.

---


**TONE & EMOTION:**

Dads who are too old to be in a band - being in a band. The mood should capture the feel of a rehearsal room/crappy pub instead of a produced track. Pre-technology era sound aesthetic - music that could realistically be performed in a pub setting.

Technical production will avoid over-produced contemporary punk styling, instead focusing on authentic garage band rawness.

---


**INSTRUMENTATION:**

Standard band setup as mapped out by the director:
- Drums
- Bass
- Guitar
- Keys
- Vocals

The vibe should capture a rehearsal room or crappy pub performance rather than a polished studio track.



**STRUCTURE:**

This is the tricky part - there's a long intro where band members introduce themselves, followed by a chorus. That's basically it, but it needs to work for multiple different durations (60s, 45s, 30s, 15s, 6s).


**CLIENT FEEDBACK:**

Genre selection of grunge/punk specifically chosen for its versatility in accommodating varied lyrical topics without forcing artificial rhyme schemes. This also allows for big hooky melodies. The director mentioned the rawer side of pop punk several times - think The Chats style.

Faster tempo seems like the smarter move. We need some big ear worm hooks here - this has gotta be stuck in everyone's head!

## AI Suggestions

> [!NOTE]
> **Creative Concept:**
>
> Create an infectious, raw garage-punk anthem that celebrates middle-aged mates reclaiming their youth through music. The track should feel like a snapshot of a genuine pub band rehearsal - rough around the edges but undeniably catchy. Think "dad rock" meets punk energy with self-aware, relatable lyrics that don't try too hard to be funny but land through their earnest delivery.
>
> The long intro works as character establishment - each band member's introduction builds anticipation before the explosive, singalong chorus drops. This structure mirrors how real pub bands build energy in a room.
>
>
> **Musical Direction:**
>
> - **Genre:** Raw garage punk/grunge with pop-punk hooks (The Chats, early Green Day, The Strokes meets garage rock)
> - **Tempo:** 150-170 BPM - fast enough to feel energetic and youthful, loose enough to feel like a garage rehearsal
> - **Key Elements:**
>   - Slightly out-of-tune guitars for authenticity
>   - Driving, simple drum patterns with occasional timing inconsistencies
>   - Punchy bass that holds it together
>   - Raw, unpolished vocals with group shouts on the chorus
>   - Minimal keys - just accent moments
>
>
> **Sound Design Ideas:**
>
> - **Opening:** Count-in stick clicks, ambient room noise, someone adjusting their amp
> - **Intro Build:** Each member introduces themselves over building instrumental layers
> - **Drop:** Full band hits hard on the chorus with gang vocals
> - **Texture:** Room reverb, slight amp buzz, pick noise on guitar strings
> - **Special moments:**
>   - Brief false starts or timing hiccups that get corrected
>   - Someone laughing or encouraging between sections
>   - Raw drum fills that aren't perfectly in time
>   - Guitar feedback between phrases
>
>
> **Sonic Logo/Audio Mnemonic:**
>
> The chorus hook itself becomes the mnemonic - a simple, shoutable phrase with a power chord progression that's impossible to forget. Think "We are OLD MATES!" delivered with full band energy and gang vocals. The chord progression: C5 - G5 - F5 - C5, simple but anthemic.
>
>
> **Creative Intent:**
>
> This track connects to Coopers' brand values of mateship, authenticity, and not taking yourself too seriously. By celebrating middle-aged blokes pursuing their passion despite being "past their prime," we tap into Coopers' positioning as a beer for genuine, down-to-earth mates. The garage band aesthetic and pub rehearsal vibe mirrors where Coopers is enjoyed - unpretentious venues where real friendships happen. The infectiously catchy chorus ensures brand memorability while the raw, honest production prevents it from feeling like a try-hard commercial attempt at "cool." It's relatable, fun, and authentically Australian.

## SUNO prompt

```
[Title: Old Mates] [Genre: Raw garage punk/grunge with pop-punk hooks] [Mood: Energetic, nostalgic, self-aware, rebellious, fun] [Instruments: Slightly detuned electric guitars, driving bass, loose drumming, occasional keys, raw vocals with gang shouts] [Structure: Extended intro with character introductions → Build → Explosive chorus → Bridge → Chorus out] [Tempo: 160 BPM fast punk]

[Intro 00:00-00:20] Count-in stick clicks, room ambience, amp buzz. Each band member introduces themselves over building layers - "I'm Dave on drums," "Pete on bass," etc. Guitars feedback slightly between intros.

[Build 00:20-00:28] All instruments enter together, building tension with power chord chugs and accelerating drum fills.

[Drop/Chorus 00:28-00:43] Full band explosion with gang vocals: "WE ARE OLD MATES!" Simple C-G-F-C power chord progression. Raw, shouty delivery. Everyone singing together.

[Bridge 00:43-00:52] Stripped back to just bass and drums, one guitar playing loose lead line. Builds back up.

[Chorus Out 00:52-01:00] Return to full band chorus, ending with feedback and natural room decay.

Requirements: Garage band authenticity, slight timing imperfections, pub rehearsal room reverb, 12 frames silence top/tail.
```
