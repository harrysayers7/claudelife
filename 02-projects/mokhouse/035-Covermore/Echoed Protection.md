### "Echoed Protection"

 **The concept:** Single vocal statement — "Cover-more" — then the whistle answers back with the same melody. Clean call and response. Locking in the melody through repetition.

**What it does:**

- Immediate recognition - vocal establishes the brand, whistle reinforces it
- Whistle = instant recall. Human, casual, sticks in your head
- Repetition without redundancy - allowing the listener to make the decsion with the whistle as the confirmation

**Brand fit:** Direct and confident. No build-up needed - Cover-more states itself clearly, then confirms it. The whistle makes it memorable without overcomplicating. It's the sonic equivalent of "heard and understood." Simple, effective, locked in.

**Bottom line:** One statement, one echo. Melody sticks because you hear it twice in two seconds.
