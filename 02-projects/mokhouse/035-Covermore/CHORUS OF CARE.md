### "Chorus of Care"

**The concept:** Layered vocal harmony that builds itself in real-time. One voice says "Cover-more," another answers, then multiple voices stack together into one unified statement. Spatial, harmonic, completely covered with care. Then a carefree whistle carries the melody home.

**What it does:**

- Protection layering up - coverage expanding as you hear it
- Individual concerns resolving into one solution
- The spatial spread makes it feel complete, like you're surrounded with care like youre covered completely on your travels
- Whistle = instant recall. Simple, human, memorable. Locks the melody in your head. Similar to you checking the last item off your list before you depart on you travels.

**Brand fit:** Cover-more brings everything together - multiple types of coverage, multiple scenarios, one answer. The build creates momentum. By the time all voices hit, it feels inevitable. The whistle seals it - casual, confident, like walking away knowing you're sorted.

**Bottom line:** Protection that surrounds you, punctuated by a melody you can't forget.
