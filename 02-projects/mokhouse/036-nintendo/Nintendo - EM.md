## Nintendo Exchange Mode Brief

**CREATIVE DIRECTION:**

A really sweet, endearing score for Nintendo. We already have a very solid reference track in place so there's no need to reinvent the wheel with this one. The structure, instrumentation and feel are pretty nicely in place.


Unlike other Nintendo spots we don't need to worry about the gameplay music integrating with the score! The focus here is all about the story.


**TONE & EMOTION:**

The tone of the ref is in a great spot. They mentioned that they like the way everyone who has seen the ad has a "nice sigh" at the end of it - because it is quite adorable :)


**INSTRUMENTATION:**

Ref track is a great blueprint - no need to reinvent the wheel here. Glenn's only thought (not from client/agency) is that the reverb on the taiko drums felt a bit much from 1 min onwards.


**STRUCTURE:**

Follow the ref for both the 3 min version and the 60 sec version. The editor has done a great job of cutting it down.


**PACING/TEMPO:**

Same as the ref :)


**CLIENT FEEDBACK:**

"Like the reference track but better!" - Matt (Director)

Client is already quite happy with where the reference is at.

## AI Suggestions

> [!NOTE]
> **Creative Concept:**
>
> Create a heartwarming, story-driven score that evokes the "adorable sigh" moment the client loves. Focus on emotional storytelling through melody and orchestration, building to a sweet, satisfying resolution. The music should feel timeless yet modern, warm yet polished - "the reference track but better."
>
>
> **Musical Direction:**
>
> - **Genre:** Cinematic orchestral with Japanese influences, heartwarming adventure
> - **Tempo:** Moderate (around 100-110 BPM), matching reference track pacing
> - **Key Elements:**
>   - Piano as emotional anchor and melodic lead
>   - String ensemble for warmth and swells
>   - Taiko drums for Nintendo's Japanese heritage (lighter reverb after 1min mark)
>   - Woodwinds (flute, clarinet) for whimsical character moments
>   - Subtle synth pads for modern polish without overwhelming organic feel
>
>
> **Sound Design Ideas:**
>
> - **Opening (0:00-0:30):** Gentle piano introduction establishing the main theme, subtle string bed building anticipation
> - **Build (0:30-1:30):** Introduce woodwinds and light percussion, melody develops with growing orchestration, taiko enters gently
> - **Main Journey (1:30-2:30):** Full orchestral palette, emotional peaks and valleys following the narrative arc, taiko presence with controlled reverb
> - **Resolution (2:30-3:00):** Satisfying emotional payoff, strings swell to the "sigh" moment, gentle piano return for warmth
> - **60s Version:** Condensed journey hitting all emotional beats efficiently
>
>
> **Sonic Logo/Audio Mnemonic:**
>
> The main piano theme should be instantly recognizable and emotionally resonant - a simple, memorable 4-6 note motif that can bookend the piece and become synonymous with Nintendo's Exchange Mode storytelling.
>
>
> **Creative Intent:**
>
> Enhance the reference track's proven emotional foundation with more refined production, cleaner mix, and subtle improvements to orchestration. The goal isn't reinvention but elevation - making listeners feel even more connected to the story while maintaining the "adorable" quality that resonates with audiences. Focus on the human connection and storytelling that makes Nintendo special.
