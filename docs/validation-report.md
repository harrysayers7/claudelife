### ✅ Deployment Approach (100%)

- [x] **Hosting**: Vercel (Sydney region for AU latency)
- [x] **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions → Vercel auto-deploy
- [x] **Environments**: Development, Preview (PRs), Staging (develop), Production (main)

## 5. Open Questions Resolution

### Critical Questions (Must Resolve Before Phase 1)

#### ✅ Q1: React Query vs Server Components Balance?
**Resolution**: Hybrid approach defined in Architecture Section 3.3:
- Server Components for initial SSR load
- React Query for client-side caching, polling, optimistic updates
- Server Components pass `initialData` to Client Components

**Action**: None required - pattern is clear.

---

#### ✅ Q2: Chart Performance with 1000+ Data Points?
**Resolution**: Architecture Section 8.2 defines:
- Recharts with `<ResponsiveContainer>` for performance
- Lazy loading via `React.lazy()`
- Limit chart data to 100 points with aggregation for larger datasets

**Action**: None required - strategy is clear.

---

#### ⚠️ Q3: TanStack Table vs shadcn Data Table?
**Current Decision**: TanStack Table (headless UI) with shadcn styling
**Rationale**: More flexibility for virtual scrolling (50k+ rows)

**Recommendation**: Confirm this decision with SM agent during Phase 1 sprint planning.

**Action**: Add to Phase 1 sprint notes: "Validate TanStack Table performance with 10k row test dataset."

---

#### ⚠️ Q4: PDF Generation (Client vs Server)?
**Current Decision**: Server-side via API route (`app/api/invoices/[id]/pdf/route.ts`)
**Rationale**: Consistent rendering, avoid browser compatibility issues

**Recommendation**: Acceptable for Phase 2, but consider client-side if performance issues arise.

**Action**: Add to Phase 2 sprint notes: "Benchmark PDF generation latency (target <2s)."

---

#### ✅ Q5: Dark Mode Timing (Phase 1 Setup, Phase 6 Implementation)?
**Resolution**: Architecture Section 4.2 (UI Preferences Store) and Frontend Spec Section 8 confirm:
- Setup `useUIPreferences` Zustand store in Phase 1
- Implement dark mode toggle in Phase 6

**Action**: None required - phasing is clear.

---

### Design Questions (Can Be Resolved During Implementation)

#### ⚠️ Q6: MOKAI/MOK HOUSE Logos for Invoices?
**Current Status**: Not defined in PRD or Frontend Spec
**Impact**: Medium (affects invoice PDF template design)

**Recommendation**: Request logos before Phase 2 (Invoicing).

**Action**: Add to Phase 2 prerequisites: "Obtain MOKAI and MOK HOUSE logos (SVG or high-res PNG)."

---

#### ⚠️ Q7: Invoice Template Style Preference?
**Current Status**: Frontend Spec mentions "professional template" but no mockup
**Impact**: Low (can use default template and iterate)

**Recommendation**: Create default template in Phase 2, gather feedback from user.

**Action**: Add to Phase 2 sprint: "Design invoice PDF template (1-2 variations for review)."

---

#### ✅ Q8: Custom Brand Colors or shadcn Default?
**Resolution**: Frontend Spec Section 1.1 defines custom color palette:
- Primary: Slate 950
- Accent: Blue 500
- Chart colors: 8-color custom palette

**Action**: None required - colors are defined.

---

### Functional Clarifications

#### ✅ Q9: Multi-Entity Permissions (Single User Assumption)?
**Resolution**: PRD Section 12 (Open Questions) confirms single-user assumption for MVP
**Rationale**: User is Harrison Sayers, sole user of Personal/MOKAI/MOK HOUSE

**Action**: None required - single-user architecture is simpler for MVP.

---

#### ⚠️ Q10: Invoice Numbering (Per Entity or Global)?
**Current Status**: Not explicitly defined
**Impact**: Medium (affects invoice creation logic)

**Recommendation**: Per-entity numbering (e.g., MOKAI-001, MOK-001, PERSONAL-001)

**Action**: Add to Phase 2 sprint: "Implement per-entity invoice numbering with auto-increment."

---

#### ✅ Q11: Currency Support (AUD Only for MVP)?
**Resolution**: PRD Section 12 confirms AUD only for MVP
**Rationale**: Australian tax compliance, GST is AUD-specific

**Action**: None required - AUD-only is acceptable.

---

#### ⚠️ Q12: Recurring Transaction Automation?
**Current Status**: Table exists (`recurring_transactions`, 26 rows) but no automation defined
**Impact**: Low (manual creation acceptable for MVP)

**Recommendation**: Defer automation to post-MVP enhancement.

**Action**: Add to technical debt backlog: "Automated recurring transaction creation (cron job)."

---

#### ✅ Q13: Anomaly False Positive Handling?
**Resolution**: PRD Story 3.3.1 defines:
- Allow marking anomalies as normal/fraud
- User feedback improves ML model over time

**Action**: None required - pattern is clear.

---

### Integration Clarifications

#### ✅ Q14: UpBank Sync Trigger (Display Only for MVP)?
**Resolution**: PRD Section 2.2 confirms:
- UpBank sync is external (n8n workflow)
- Dashboard displays synced data (read-only)

**Action**: None required - dashboard is display-only for UpBank transactions.

---

#### ⚠️ Q15: ML Model Retraining Frequency?
**Current Status**: Not defined
**Impact**: Low (ML pipeline is external, MindsDB-managed)

**Recommendation**: Defer to post-MVP, use existing predictions.

**Action**: Add to technical debt backlog: "Define ML model retraining strategy (monthly?)."

---

#### ⚠️ Q16: Export to Accounting Software (Defer to Phase 6+)?
**Current Status**: Not in MVP scope
**Impact**: Low (CSV export covers basic needs)

**Recommendation**: Defer to Phase 6+ enhancement.

**Action**: Add to future enhancements: "Xero/MYOB integration (API export)."

---

### Compliance Clarifications

#### ✅ Q17: Audit Trail Level (created_at/updated_at Sufficient)?
**Resolution**: PRD Section 7 (Data Model) shows `created_at` and `updated_at` on all tables
**Rationale**: Sufficient for MVP, no regulatory requirement for detailed audit logs

**Action**: None required - timestamp-based audit trail is acceptable.

---

#### ✅ Q18: Data Retention (Indefinite for MVP)?
**Resolution**: PRD Section 12 confirms indefinite retention
**Rationale**: No regulatory requirement to delete financial data

**Action**: None required - no retention policy needed for MVP.

---

#### ✅ Q19: Multi-User Support (Single User for MVP)?
**Resolution**: PRD Section 12 confirms single-user MVP
**Rationale**: User is Harrison Sayers, sole user of all entities

**Action**: None required - single-user architecture is simpler.

---

## 6. Critical Blockers

### None Identified ✅

All critical questions have been resolved or deferred to appropriate phases. No blockers to starting Phase 1 implementation.

---

## 7. Minor Issues & Recommendations

### Issue 1: Missing Budget & Insights Page Wireframes
**Severity**: Low
**Impact**: Phase 3 (Budgets) and Phase 5 (Insights) have minimal UI specs

**Recommendation**: Refine wireframes during Phase 2, before Phase 3 begins.

**Action**: Schedule wireframe design session before Phase 3 kickoff.

---

### Issue 2: No Mobile Performance Targets
**Severity**: Low
**Impact**: Mobile load times not explicitly defined (PRD only mentions <3s on 4G for Phase 6)

**Recommendation**: Add mobile performance goal: "<3s initial load on 4G" to Phase 6 acceptance criteria.

**Action**: Update PRD Phase 6 Story 6.2.1 with mobile performance target.

---

### Issue 3: Export Format Specification Missing
**Severity**: Low
**Impact**: CSV export defined, but no column mappings or format details

**Recommendation**: Define CSV export schema during Phase 6 (Export epic).

**Action**: Add to Phase 6 sprint: "Design CSV export schema (column headers, date formats)."

---
