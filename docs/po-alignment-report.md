---

## 6. FEATURE SEQUENCING & DEPENDENCIES

**Status**: ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL PASS**
**Score**: 85/100

### 6.1 Functional Dependencies

✅ **MOSTLY CLEAR** - Epic-level dependencies stated
- Epic 1 (Foundation) → All other epics
- Epic 3 (Transactions) + Epic 4 (Invoices) → Epic 5 (Reports)
- Epic 2 (Dashboard) optional for Epic 3 (mentioned in Epic 3)

⚠️ **CRITICAL GAP**: Story-level dependencies not documented
- 41 user stories across 6 epics
- No explicit dependency graph (e.g., "Story 3.3 requires Story 3.1, 3.2")
- **Impact**: Risk of incorrect implementation order within epics

**Example Missing Dependencies**:
- Story 2.4 (Recent Transactions Widget) requires Story 3.3 (ML prediction display logic)
- Story 4.3 (PDF Generation) requires Story 4.2 (invoice data structure)
- Story 5.2 (BAS Report Page) requires Story 5.1 (BAS calculation engine)

**Recommendation**: Create story dependency matrix before implementation

### 6.2 Technical Dependencies

✅ **WELL-DEFINED** - Lower-level services before higher-level
- Supabase client setup (Story 1.2) before data fetching (Epic 2+)
- Authentication (Story 1.3) before protected routes (all other pages)
- Entity context (Story 1.5) before entity-filtered queries (Epic 2+)

### 6.3 Cross-Epic Dependencies

⚠️ **NEEDS CLARIFICATION** - Some implicit dependencies
- Epic 2 (Dashboard) uses transaction categorization display logic from Epic 3
- Epic 5 (Reports) depends on transaction data from Epic 3 and invoice data from Epic 4
- Epic 6 (Settings) provides contact management used in Epic 4 (invoices)

**Potential Issue**: Epic 4 (Invoices) Story 4.6 (Quick Add Contact) assumes contacts table exists
- Contacts table mentioned in architecture but no explicit setup story in Epic 1
- **Resolution**: Existing Supabase schema already has contacts table (verified in architecture)

---

## Gap Analysis

### 1. Missing Requirements

**None Identified** - All PRD functional requirements (FR1-FR26) and non-functional requirements (NFR1-NFR18) are addressed in epics.

### 2. Conflicting Specifications

**None Identified** - PRD, Architecture, and Frontend Spec are well-aligned.

### 3. Ambiguous Acceptance Criteria

**Minor Ambiguities**:
1. Story 2.3 (Category Pie Chart): "Top 6 categories" - what if there are exactly 6? (Edge case)
2. Story 3.4 (Category Override): "Reason field optional modal prompt" - when is modal shown?
3. Story 5.1 (BAS Calculation): "PAYG withholding fields" - not applicable for sole trader, needs conditional logic

**Recommendation**: Clarify during sprint planning, not blockers.

### 4. Unaddressed NFRs

**All NFRs Addressed** with the following notes:
- NFR10 (99.9% uptime): Vercel SLA is 99.99% for Pro plan
- NFR18 (Offline functionality): Marked as "nice-to-have" PWA feature, not in MVP

## Dependency Analysis

### Epic Dependencies (Validated)

```
Epic 1: Foundation
  ↓
Epic 2: Dashboard (optional) ←→ Epic 3: Transactions (data logic sharing)
  ↓
Epic 3: Transactions + Epic 4: Invoices
  ↓
Epic 5: Reports (requires transaction + invoice data)

Epic 6: Settings (independent, can run parallel)
```

**Critical Path**: Epic 1 → Epic 3 → Epic 4 → Epic 5 (Reports)

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- Epic 2 (Dashboard) can run parallel with Epic 3 (Transactions) after Epic 1
- Epic 6 (Settings) can run parallel with any epic after Epic 1

### Story Dependencies (Needs Documentation)

**High-Priority Stories to Sequence**:
1. **Within Epic 1**: Stories 1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3 → 1.4 → 1.5 → 1.6 → 1.7 (sequential)
2. **Within Epic 3**: Story 3.1 (list) → 3.2 (filtering) → 3.3 (ML display) → 3.4 (override)
3. **Within Epic 4**: Story 4.2 (invoice form) → 4.3 (PDF generation)
4. **Within Epic 5**: Story 5.1 (BAS engine) → 5.2 (BAS page)

**Recommendation**: Create story-level dependency matrix before sprint planning.

### Technical Prerequisites

**Must Be Completed Before Implementation Starts**:
1. ✅ Supabase project exists (already done)
2. ⚠️ Testing framework setup (add to Epic 1 or pre-Epic 1)
3. ✅ GitHub repository created
4. ✅ Vercel account ready

### External Dependencies

**No Blocking External Dependencies**:
- UpBank API: Already syncing (doesn't block dashboard)
- MindsDB: Already trained and deployed
- Email service: Optional for MVP (invoices can be downloaded manually)

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|------------|
| **Financial calculation errors** | **HIGH** | Medium | Use decimal.js for all GST calculations, 100% test coverage on calculation logic (NFR5) |
| **RLS policy bypass** | **HIGH** | Low | All queries enforce entity_id filter, penetration testing before production |
| **Large dataset performance** | Medium | Medium | Virtual scrolling for >100 transactions (NFR2), database indexes on filter fields (NFR11) |
| **PDF generation timeout** | Medium | Medium | Async job queue for batch PDFs, 5-second timeout for single invoices (NFR12) |
| **ML integration failure** | Low | Low | Read from `ai_predictions` table (isolated from MindsDB), fallback to manual categorization |

### Implementation Complexity

**By Epic** (1-10 scale):

| Epic | Complexity | Reason |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Epic 1: Foundation | 4/10 | Standard Next.js setup, existing Supabase |
| Epic 2: Dashboard | 6/10 | Recharts integration, real-time data, responsive charts |
| Epic 3: Transactions | 7/10 | Complex filtering, ML integration, bulk operations |
| Epic 4: Invoices | 8/10 | **MOST COMPLEX**: PDF generation, GST calculations, multi-step forms |
| Epic 5: Reports | 9/10 | **CRITICAL**: BAS tax compliance, financial accuracy required |
| Epic 6: Settings | 5/10 | Standard CRUD operations, admin interfaces |

**Highest Risk Epic**: **Epic 5 (Reports)** due to tax compliance requirements
- **Mitigation**: External accounting review of BAS calculation logic before production
- Unit test coverage: 100% for BAS calculations

### Integration Risks

**Low Risk Overall**:
- ✅ Supabase integration: Well-documented patterns, existing infrastructure
- ✅ MindsDB: Read-only access to predictions table, no direct API calls
- ✅ UpBank: Dashboard doesn't call UpBank API (reads from synced data)

**Moderate Risk**:
- ⚠️ PDF generation: @react-pdf/renderer performance with complex invoices
  - **Mitigation**: Test with 20+ line item invoices, implement timeout handling
