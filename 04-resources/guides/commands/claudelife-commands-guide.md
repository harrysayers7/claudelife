### /extract-daily-content
**Created**: 2025-10-17 10:00 | **Replaces**: /extract-diary, /extract-insights, /extract-context | **Updated**: 2025-10-19 14:00 (v1.2: Smart memory detection)

##### What it does:
Smart AI-powered extraction that transforms diary narratives into contextual knowledge and **automatically suggests memory updates**. Uses AI to classify entries (Diary/Insight/Context/Idea), transforms diary entries into third-person factual statements for context files (removes dates, pronouns, feelings), analyzes relevance to all 24 areas (>80% confidence), routes to multiple destinations with custom factual extraction per context file, creates cross-links to source + related context files, auto-creates diary files per area, and **detects Serena/Graphiti memory update opportunities** with user approval. Context files: bullet points (no date headers). Diary files: preserve narrative with date headers.

##### When to use it:
Use after adding notes to daily entries. AI extracts contextual facts from diary narratives, routes them appropriately, and suggests memory updates. Example: "Today I built a Supabase database for MOKAI" → Tech context: "Supabase: Financial tracking database", MOKAI context: "Financial tracking system: Supabase database", **+ Serena memory suggestion** (tech stack pattern). After extraction, choose to update all/selective/skip/later for suggested memories. Shows routing plan and memory suggestions before committing.

**Usage**: `/extract-daily-content`
**File**: `.claude/commands/extract-daily-content.md`
**Old Commands**: Archived in `.claude/commands/archive/`

##### What it does:
Updates Serena MCP's memory files (`.serena/memories/`) to reflect recent codebase changes. **NEW**: `--auto` flag enables intelligent change detection with confidence-based decisions (HIGH: auto-update, MEDIUM: ask confirmation, LOW: skip). Post-commit hook now creates trigger file for HIGH-confidence changes (80-100), auto-updating Serena in next Claude Code session without user action.

##### When to use it:
Run after adding new commands, scripts, MCP servers, or major changes. **NEW**: Use `--auto` for smart detection. Post-commit hook handles HIGH-confidence updates automatically (new commands/MCP servers). For MEDIUM-confidence (modified commands, patterns), run `/update-serena-memory --auto` to review. Manual mode still available for specific categories.

**Usage**: `/update-serena-memory`, `/update-serena-memory --auto`, `/update-serena-memory [category]`
**File**: `.claude/commands/update-serena-memory.md`
**Hook**: `.claude/hooks/post-commit-serena-sync.sh` (automatic trigger creation)

---

### Post-Commit Hooks (Automated)
**Created**: 2025-10-15

The claudelife system includes intelligent post-commit hooks that run automatically after git commits:

##### 1. Post-Commit Serena Sync (`.claude/hooks/post-commit-serena-sync.sh`)
Analyzes commits and intelligently decides when to update Serena's memory:
- **HIGH confidence (80-100)**: Creates trigger file (`.serena-auto-update-trigger.json`) for automatic update
- **MEDIUM confidence (50-79)**: Suggests running `/update-serena-memory --auto`
- **LOW confidence (0-49)**: Silent skip

**Triggers**: New commands (+85), MCP servers (+85), agent changes (+85), modified commands (+25), experimental commits (-20)

##### 2. Post-System-Completion (`.claude/hooks/post-system-completion.sh`)
Detects substantial feature completions and suggests documentation:
- **HIGH confidence (80+)**: Substantial system completion detected
- **MEDIUM confidence (65-79)**: Feature addition detected
- **LOW-MEDIUM confidence (50-64)**: Consider if documentation needed

**Triggers**: `feat:` commits (+30), 5+ new files (+40), system-related files (+25), config changes (+15), reduces for fix/refactor/chore (-30)

**Suggestion**: Recommends `/document-system "[system name]"` to capture context while fresh

**Integration**: Both hooks run automatically via `.git/hooks/post-commit` dispatcher

---

### Context7 Smart Detection Hook (Automated)
**Created**: 2025-10-16

Intelligent prompt analysis hook that detects when to use Context7 MCP for up-to-date library documentation.

##### How it works:
Analyzes every prompt using multi-factor confidence scoring:
- **Library Detection (40%)**: Identifies fast-moving frameworks (Next.js, React Query, Trigger.dev, Prisma, etc.) and complex API libraries (FastAPI, Stripe, Supabase, etc.)
- **Version Sensitivity (30%)**: Detects "new feature", "latest", version mentions, "breaking change", "migration"
- **Documentation Signals (30%)**: Catches "how do I", "example", "implement", "api reference", etc.

##### Confidence Levels:
- **HIGH (80%+)**: 🎯 Strong recommendation with specific usage guidance
- **MEDIUM-HIGH (65-79%)**: 📚 Gentle suggestion to consider Context7
- **MEDIUM (50-64%)**: 💡 Subtle hint
- **LOW (<50%)**: No suggestion shown

##### Example Triggers:
```
✅ HIGH: "How do I use the new Next.js after() function?"
  → Confidence: 0.9 (library + version + doc signal)
  → Output: "🎯 Detected next.js - Context7 highly recommended for latest docs"

✅ MEDIUM-HIGH: "How does Prisma's interactive transactions API work?"
  → Confidence: 0.7 (library + doc signal)
  → Output: "📚 Consider using Context7 for up-to-date prisma documentation"

❌ LOW: "What's the difference between async and sync in Python?"
  → Confidence: 0.3 (generic concept, no specific library)
  → No suggestion
```

##### Smart Filtering:
- **Excluded**: Stable languages (JavaScript, Python, TypeScript), generic concepts, architecture discussions
- **Prioritized**: Fast-moving frameworks, version-specific queries, API implementation questions
- **Ignored**: Prompts already containing "context7"

##### Configuration:
**File**: `.claude/hooks/context7_detector.py`
**Hook Type**: `UserPromptSubmit` (runs before every message)
**Requirements**: Python 3.6+, no external dependencies

##### Customization:
Edit `context7_detector.py` to:
- Add libraries to `FAST_MOVING_LIBS` or `COMPLEX_API_LIBS`
- Adjust confidence thresholds in `generate_reminder()`
- Add custom detection patterns to `VERSION_PATTERNS` or `DOCUMENTATION_SIGNALS`

##### Testing:
```bash
# Test detection manually
python3 .claude/hooks/context7_detector.py "How do I use Next.js after function?"

# View JSON output
python3 .claude/hooks/context7_detector.py "Implement Stripe checkout with latest API" | jq
```

**Documentation**: `.claude/hooks/README-context7-detector.md`
**Integration**: Configured in `.claude/settings.json` under `hooks.UserPromptSubmit`

### /mokai-status
**Created**: 2025-10-14 | **Updated**: 2025-10-14 (Inbox task scanning + Serena MCP)

##### What it does:
Daily strategic status command that reads unprocessed diary notes, **scans MOKAI task files in /00-inbox/tasks/ grouped by priority (urgent/high/normal)**, extracts wins/blockers/learnings/tasks using Serena pattern matching, dynamically updates Phase 1 checklist via fuzzy task matching (auto-marks completed tasks), updates dashboard automatically, retrieves Serena memory for week-over-week comparison, and provides strategic guidance on what to work on RIGHT NOW. **Prioritizes urgent inbox tasks over routine Phase 1 tasks**. Uses `.mokai-tracker.json` for incremental processing (only reads new notes).

##### When to use it:
Run every morning (30 seconds) to get your strategic direction. **Safe to run multiple times per day** - today's diary note is always re-read to capture same-day updates, with deduplication preventing duplicate entries. Automatically processes only new diary notes from previous days + scans all MOKAI task files in inbox. Fuzzy matching detects task completion (e.g., "finished reading Indigenous section" matches checklist task). Acts as accountability partner telling you exactly what to focus on today, with urgent inbox tasks surfaced prominently.

**Usage**: `/mokai-status`
**File**: `.claude/commands/mokai-status.md`
**Requires**: Serena MCP
**Diary Location**: `01-areas/business/mokai/diary/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

##### What it does:
Interactive skill creation wizard for Claude Code Skills. Guides you through defining skill metadata (name max 64 chars, description max 1024 chars with trigger words), structuring SKILL.md with progressive disclosure patterns, organizing reference files, creating executable scripts with error handling, and implementing workflows with feedback loops. Ensures skills follow Anthropic best practices: concise instructions, appropriate degrees of freedom (high/medium/low), third-person descriptions, and proper file organization. Outputs production-ready skill directories with YAML frontmatter and structured markdown.

##### When to use it:
Use when creating new Claude Code Skills for automation, complex workflows, or specialized tasks. The wizard ensures proper skill architecture with progressive disclosure (core instructions + optional detail levels), workflow patterns with checklists, feedback loops (validate → fix → repeat), and testing strategies. Creates skills that are discoverable, maintainable, and follow official Anthropic guidelines. Supports template-based patterns, conditional workflows, and script integration.

**Usage**: `/create-skill "description"` or `/create-skill` (interactive)
**File**: `.claude/commands/create-skill.md`
**Reference**: `04-resources/research/SKILLz.md` (Anthropic documentation)
**Output**: `.claude/skills/{skill-name}/` (SKILL.md + optional reference.md + scripts/)
