### Here’s the simple way to picture it:

FastAPI is the web “server” piece. You can spin it up in the cloud.

MCP is the “wrapper/translator” piece that makes your tools understandable to Claude (or another AI).


So if you want to connect Notion, Supabase, and any other API (say Google Drive or Stripe), you can:

1. Build one FastAPI app that contains different routes (like different doors in the same building).

/notion → talks to Notion API

/supabase → talks to your Supabase project

/drive → talks to Google Drive API



2. Wrap the whole thing in MCP so Claude knows:

“This tool has commands: get_notion_page, query_supabase, list_drive_files.”



3. Then, from Claude’s side, it looks like one connector with multiple tools inside it.

Why that’s powerful

You don’t have to manage 5 separate connectors.

You can build cross-app logic:

Example: Claude asks “Save my Supabase query results into Notion.”

Your FastAPI MCP server calls Supabase, gets the data, then calls Notion, and hands it back as one clean response.


It becomes your hub, and the AI sees it as a single “super tool.”

So yeah — what you’re describing is exactly the design:
👉 One FastAPI MCP server can bundle all your APIs and expose them to Claude as one set of tools, and you can orchestrate them however you like.

Do you want me to sketch a mini example layout (like a fake FastAPI MCP with /notion and /supabase endpoints) so you can see what it looks like in code?
