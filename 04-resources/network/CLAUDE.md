# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 People & Businesses – Context Layer

This folder is a **relational map of my network**.
It includes individuals I know personally, work with, or collaborate with, as well as businesses I’m involved with or connected to.

Each `.md` file serves as a **profile card** for that entity, detailing their background, my relationship to them, and any relevant context that could influence creative or strategic decisions.

### 📌 Usage Tips
- Reference this folder before ideation to see who could be involved or what capabilities exist in my network.
- Use it to enrich brainstorming sessions (e.g., “What could I build with X company and Y person?”).
- Update profiles regularly to reflect new roles, projects, or changes in the relationship.
