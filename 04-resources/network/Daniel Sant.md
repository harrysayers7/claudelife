Dan Sant from Cult Artists

#### Website blurb:

"Cult Artists is a Sydney-based entertainment agency working with a diverse range of established & emerging artists across Australia, New Zealand & Asia. The agency is part of the Secret Sounds & Live Nation group of companies.

 Our agency and staff have built strong reputations within the industry, with a strong focus on being creative and forward-thinking in terms of our approach to developing artists’ long term live careers, with a family minded approach to our artists and their teams."

So Dan has been my / SAFIA's booking agent for 10+ years and weve established a great friendship beyond the professional level
