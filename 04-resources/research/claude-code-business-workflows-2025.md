Benefits:
  - Unified client view (projects + invoices + contacts)
  - Better pipeline visibility
  - Automated follow-ups

Effort: 2-3 hours setup
Value: High (better client management)
```

**Decision**: ⚠️ Wait - Only if client volume increases (>5 active clients)

---

#### 2. **Automated Weekly Business Report** (Medium Impact, Low Effort)

**Gap**: Manual weekly review process, no automated reporting.

**Recommendation**: Create `/mokai-report` slash command
```yaml
What it does:
  - Reads week's diary notes
  - Queries Supabase for financials
  - Checks Linear for client progress (if added)
  - Generates executive summary

Output:
  - Revenue: $X this week (vs last week)
  - Active clients: X
  - Blockers: Top 3
  - Wins: Top 5
  - Action items: Urgent priorities

Effort: 1-2 hours
Value: Medium (time savings, insights)
```

**Decision**: ✅ Good idea - Enhances `/mokai-weekly` without overkill

---

#### 3. **Email Automation** (Low Impact, Medium Effort)

**Gap**: Gmail MCP available but unused.

**Recommendation**: **Skip for now**

  - Automated follow-up reminders
```

**Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Value**: Medium (improves client management)
**Risk**: Low (Linear is lightweight)

**Decision**: 🟡 Optional - Your call based on client volume

---

### Priority 3: Research Integration Workflow (Low Priority)

**What to add**: Connect research findings → action items automatically

**Implementation**:
```markdown
After `/research` or `/quick-research`:
1. Ask: "Should I extract action items from this research?"
2. If yes: Parse findings → create inbox tasks
3. Tag tasks with #research for tracking
```

**Effort**: 1 hour
**Value**: Low (nice-to-have)
**Risk**: Very low

**Decision**: 🟡 Optional - Only if you do research frequently

---

## What NOT to Add (Overkill Warning)
