ðŸŽ¯ Core Idea

The book introduces the Zettelkasten (slip-box) method as a way to think, write, and learn more effectively. Itâ€™s less about storing information and more about creating a system that helps ideas connect, grow, and lead naturally to writing and producing work.

ðŸ“Œ Key Principles

1. Write Permanent Notes

Every time you learn something, rephrase it in your own words.

Keep it short, clear, and self-contained (so it makes sense without outside context).

Store these notes in your slip-box, not scattered across different notebooks.



2. Link Notes Together

The power comes from connections.

Each new note should link to related notes.

Over time, this web of connections creates new insights.



3. Distinguish Note Types

Fleeting Notes: Quick jottings, thoughts, reminders.

Literature Notes: Notes from reading, paraphrased in your own words.

Permanent Notes: The refined, long-term notes that go into your system.



4. Focus on Writing as Thinking

Writing is not the output of thinking â€” it is the process of thinking.

The slip-box makes writing projects easier, since youâ€™re always building from a network of existing notes.



5. Make Notes Atomic

One idea per note.

This makes linking and recombining easier.

ðŸ§  Benefits

You learn more deeply because you process everything in your own words.

You see patterns and connections between ideas.

You avoid starting from scratch when writing papers, essays, or projects â€” your slip-box already contains structured thinking.

You reduce reliance on motivation or memory: the system supports consistent progress.

ðŸš€ Practical Workflow

1. Capture fleeting thoughts quickly.


2. Take literature notes when reading.


3. Turn the best into permanent notes in your own words.


4. File them into your slip-box, linking to existing notes.


5. Use the growing network of notes as the basis for writing.

ðŸ‘‰ In short: Donâ€™t just collect information. Connect it, rewrite it in your own words, and let your notes system do the heavy lifting for thinking and writing.
