Based on where you are right now - early-stage CEO needing to close deals, manage client relationships, and sound confident doing it - here's the single book I'd start with and the order I'd tackle the rest:

##  **START HERE:
 "Never Split the Difference" by Chris Voss**

This is your foundation. It's specifically about high-stakes conversations (negotiations, difficult discussions, client interactions) and it's immediately applicable. You'll learn:
- How to handle pricing discussions with confidence
- How to respond when clients push back on scope or timeline
- How to build rapport quickly on Zoom calls
- Tactical phrases you can use word-for-word in your next conversation

It's also a fast read (you could finish it in a week) and entertaining - written by an FBI hostage negotiator, so it's full of real stories. You'll finish it feeling equipped, not overwhelmed.

## **The Reading Order After That:**

**2. "Crucial Conversations" (Patterson et al)**
- **Why now**: You'll need this for tough conversations with Jack about delivery quality, Kelly about responsibilities, or contractors about performance
- **When to read**: After your first few client calls, when you're starting to hit real business friction
- **Time investment**: 2 weeks

**3. "The First 90 Days" (Michael Watkins)**
- **Why now**: You're literally in your first 90 days as CEO. This will help you establish credibility and avoid common leadership mistakes
- **When to read**: Month 2-3 of running Mokai
- **Time investment**: 2 weeks, but you'll reference it for months

**4. "Made to Stick" (Heath brothers)**
- **Why now**: Once you're having conversations, you need your ideas to land and be remembered. This teaches clear, persuasive communication
- **When to read**: Before you start building capability statements and proposals
- **Time investment**: 1-2 weeks

**5. "The Consulting Bible" (Alan Weiss)**
- **Why now**: By now you'll have done a few projects. This book will help you position Mokai more strategically and command better pricing
- **When to read**: After your first 2-3 successful deliveries
- **Time investment**: 3-4 weeks (it's dense and practical)

**Optional (based on specific needs):**
- **"Presence" (Amy Cuddy)**: If you're still feeling nervous before big calls after practicing for a month
- **"HBR Guide to Better Business Writing"**: If your proposals or capability statements feel unclear

## **My Honest Take**

Given that Mokai is in early operations and you need to close deals **now**, I'd actually suggest something even more pragmatic:

Read **"Never Split the Difference"** first (maybe 30-60 minutes per day for a week), then **immediately apply** what you learn to your next client call or contractor negotiation. Don't wait to finish all the books before acting.

Then, based on what goes well or poorly in those real situations, pick the next book that addresses your biggest gap. If you struggled with a tough conversation with Jack, read "Crucial Conversations" next. If you felt like you didn't establish authority with a government procurement officer, read "The First 90 Days."

Books are useful, but you'll learn faster by doing real deals and then reading to fix specific problems than by trying to read everything upfront. You're not building a consulting firm in theory - you're doing it right now. Let the real challenges guide your learning.
