Yeah, so I spent most of the day trying to set up Claude Life. I added a bunch of new features. I feel like I probably shouldn't have spent all day doing it and maybe should have studied a bit, but what can you do? Trying to build a Supabase UI. I spoke to Jack earlier today. We're going to have a meeting next week with our mokai accountant and go over how we should set up the trust. He did recommend a particular structuring as we may need to ensure we're heavily protected because we'll be dealing with such big sums of money.
