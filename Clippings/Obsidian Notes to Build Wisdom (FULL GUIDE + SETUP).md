The most powerful second brain system is without a doubt: Obsidian. After using it everyday for 8 months, here is my easy & complete guide on how you can use Obsidian to build wisdom.

I want to give a massive thank you and respect to all the writers and creators who have made their guides on Obsidian before me! Especially the following guides are more than worth checking out:

Christopher's guide: https://youtu.be/xR5-0XDkwU0?si=Zbad1WEuPpDAmIvK
Odysseas' guide: https://youtu.be/hSTy\_BInQs8?si=1IOoaJSRq9cFeuWN
