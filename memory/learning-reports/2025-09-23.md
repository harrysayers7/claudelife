# Learning Report - September 23, 2025

## Success Patterns (Keep doing)
- **Context7 research workflow**: Successfully used Context7 to identify best Docker MCP server option (`quantgeekdev/docker-mcp` with 9.3 trust score)
- **MCP server validation process**: Discovered non-existent package, found alternatives, and selected optimal solution
- **Trust score evaluation**: Prioritized higher trust score packages for critical infrastructure integrations
- **Configuration verification**: Properly configured Docker MCP with `uvx` command and updated Claude settings
- **User interruption respect**: Stopped npm search when user redirected to use Context7 instead
- **Automated installation handling**: `uvx docker-mcp` automatically installs on first run, simplifying setup

## Failure Patterns (Stop doing)
- **Assuming package availability**: Initial attempt to use `@modelcontextprotocol/server-docker` without verification
- **Proceeding without research**: Nearly configured non-existent package before Context7 research
- **Direct package installation attempts**: Should research first before attempting installations

## Optimizations Discovered
- **Context7 as primary research tool**: More effective than npm search for finding maintained MCP servers
- **Trust score filtering**: Libraries with 9.0+ trust scores are generally more reliable for production use
- **uvx over npm for Python tools**: uvx provides better isolation and automatic dependency management
- **MCP configuration workflow**: Research → validate → configure → enable → test sequence

## User Preferences Noted
- **Research before implementation**: Appreciates Context7 research to identify best available tools
- **Quality over speed**: Prefers finding the right tool rather than using first available option
- **Configuration validation**: Expects confirmation that new services are properly set up
- **Tool interruption acceptance**: Values when assistant adapts to better suggestions mid-task

## New Knowledge Captured
- **Docker MCP Server**: `quantgeekdev/docker-mcp` provides container management tools via MCP
- **Available tools**: list-containers, create-container, get-logs, deploy-compose, container lifecycle management
- **Installation method**: `uvx docker-mcp` for automatic dependency handling
- **Configuration pattern**: Standard MCP stdio setup with uvx command

## Pattern Integration Results
- **Successfully added** 3 new successful patterns to CLAUDE.md
- **Successfully added** 2 new user preferences to CLAUDE.md
- **Successfully added** 2 new deprecated approaches to CLAUDE.md
- **Updated baseline** for MCP server configuration workflows

## System Health Status
- Learning pattern recognition: ✅ Enhanced with Context7 integration
- MCP server configuration: ✅ New workflow established
- Tool research methodology: ✅ Context7 prioritized
- User preference tracking: ✅ Updated with research preferences
- Configuration validation: ✅ Improved Docker MCP setup process

## Key Insights
1. **Context7 research prevents configuration failures**: Saved time by identifying non-existent packages early
2. **Trust scores correlate with reliability**: 9.3 trust score package was well-maintained and documented
3. **User values research-driven decisions**: Appreciates thorough investigation before implementation
4. **uvx simplifies Python tool management**: Better than npm for Python-based MCP servers
5. **MCP ecosystem is evolving**: Some official packages don't exist yet, community alternatives often better

## Next Learning Opportunities
- Monitor Docker MCP server performance after restart
- Track effectiveness of Context7 research in future MCP configurations
- Evaluate trust score correlation with actual package quality
- Document other high-trust MCP servers for future reference
