# Learning & Memory Report - September 22, 2025

## Success Patterns (Keep doing)
- **Infrastructure diagnosis methodology**: SSH → service status → container check → configuration analysis → targeted fix
- **Server infrastructure awareness**: Understanding service relationships (Docker containers, reverse proxy, domain mapping)
- **Direct problem resolution**: Fixed n8n.sayers.app outage in 10 minutes with minimal explanation
- **Todo list tracking**: Used TodoWrite to track progress during complex troubleshooting
- **Verification-oriented approach**: Tested both localhost and domain endpoints to confirm resolution
- **Command pattern recognition**: Properly respond to slash commands like /learn for system management
- **Performance data tracking**: Maintain structured learning reports and pattern analysis

## Failure Patterns (Stop doing)
- **Forcing tool completion**: Never continue with tool operations after user rejection
- **Ignoring user interruptions**: Always pause immediately when user provides direction
- **Assumption-based file operations**: Always verify file existence before attempting edits

## Optimizations Discovered
- **Learning system effectiveness**: /learn command successfully identifies and updates behavioral patterns
- **Pattern persistence**: Successful approaches from September 20 remain valid and effective
- **User boundary awareness**: System correctly identifies when to stop and wait for user input
- **File operation reliability**: Improved error handling for directory vs file operations

## User Preferences Noted
- **Server infrastructure troubleshooting preference**: Quick, systematic diagnosis over lengthy analysis
- **Immediate verification expected**: User wants confirmation that fixes actually work
- **Minimal process documentation**: Focus on resolution, not extensive process explanation
- **Tool use boundaries**: Values system that respects interruptions and user control
- **Learning-oriented system**: Appreciates system that adapts and improves from interactions

## Recommended Next Steps
1. **Enhance interruption detection**: Improve recognition of when user wants to provide alternative direction
2. **Expand tool rejection handling**: Apply immediate-stop pattern to all tool operations
3. **Strengthen file operation validation**: Always verify file/directory status before operations
4. **Continue learning analysis**: Regular /learn sessions to track evolving patterns

## System Health
- Learning pattern recognition: ✅ Improved
- Tool use boundary respect: ✅ Enhanced
- Performance tracking: ✅ Active
- User preference adaptation: ✅ Updated
- File operation reliability: ⚠️ Needs continued validation patterns

## Entities Captured
- **Sayers Server Infrastructure**: Complete server profile with IP, services, and domain mappings
- **n8n Service Outage Resolution**: Full incident documentation with root cause and solution

## Relationships Mapped
- **Caddy ← manages → Domain Routing**: Caddy handles all reverse proxy for sayers.app subdomains
- **Docker Containers ← hosted_on → Sayers Server**: Multiple services running in containerized environment
- **n8n ← depends_on → Caddy Configuration**: n8n accessibility requires proper reverse proxy setup

## Key Infrastructure Knowledge
- Server: 134.199.159.190 (sayers-server)
- Reverse Proxy: Caddy (not nginx)
- Configuration: /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
- Services: n8n, Supabase, ERPNext, Trigger.dev, Dify
- Domains: n8n.sayers.app, supa.sayers.app, admin.sayers.app, brain.sayers.app

## Key Insights
- Server infrastructure diagnosis benefits from systematic, methodical approach
- User values quick problem resolution over detailed process documentation
- Infrastructure awareness (Docker, reverse proxy relationships) essential for effective troubleshooting
- Learning system is effective for continuous improvement
- Pattern documentation in CLAUDE.md successfully guides behavior
