# Learning Report - September 20, 2025

## Success Patterns (Keep doing)
- **Automation rule structure**: Well-defined triggers with confidence thresholds and confirmation requirements
- **Proactive Friday afternoon reports**: Automated weekly wrap-up without confirmation
- **Context-aware task categorization**: Automatic detection of Mokai-related content
- **Voice-to-task conversion**: Streamlined task creation from voice input

## Failure Patterns (Stop doing)
- **No tracked failures yet**: System is in early setup phase
- **Empty performance tracking**: Need to establish baseline metrics

## Optimizations Discovered
- **Task Master integration**: System has comprehensive task management via MCP
- **Memory graph structure**: Good foundation for entity relationship tracking
- **Automation triggers**: Well-balanced between autonomous and confirmation-required actions
- **Context loading strategy**: Token-efficient hierarchical loading (Level 0/1/2)

## User Preferences Noted
- **Direct, action-oriented communication**: Skip pleasantries, focus on getting things done
- **Business context awareness**: Mokai (Indigenous tech consultancy), cybersecurity focus
- **Minimal file creation**: Only create files when absolutely necessary
- **Prefer editing over creating**: Always edit existing files rather than create new ones

## Recommended Next Steps
1. **Establish performance baselines**: Begin tracking daily metrics
2. **Expand automation rules**: Add server management and n8n workflow triggers
3. **Enhance Mokai context**: Create dedicated business project templates
4. **Optimize token usage**: Implement /compact command for context management

## System Health
- Memory structure: ✅ Established
- Automation rules: ✅ Active (5 triggers configured)
- Task Master: ✅ Available via MCP
- Performance tracking: ⚠️ Needs baseline data
