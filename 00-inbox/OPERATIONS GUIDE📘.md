# Operational Guide for an Indigenous-Owned Cybersecurity Consultancy in Australia

Daily Operations & Rhythms

## CEO’s Typical Day/Week:

As CEO of a prime contractor cybersecurity firm, expect a mix of strategic and operational tasks each day. Mornings often begin with checking emails for client updates or any overnight incident alerts. A daily stand-up (even if informal) with your CTO (Jack) and COO (Kelly) is common to review project statuses, contractor deliverables, and any urgent issues. Mid-days might involve client meetings (sales calls, project check-ins, or kickoff meetings for new engagements) and internal meetings (e.g. finance review, marketing strategy). Afternoons are often spent on business development activities (proposal writing, networking outreach) or reviewing key deliverables (e.g. ensuring a penetration test report meets quality standards before it goes to the client). In a given week, you might have a Monday leadership meeting to set priorities, mid-week project sync meetings, and a Friday wrap-up to capture lessons and ensure nothing is left outstanding into the next week. The CEO wears multiple hats – switching from high-level strategy to hands-on tasks like approving invoices or proofreading reports – so time management is crucial. Many leaders rigorously manage their calendar to balance these responsibilities.

### Meeting Cadence:

Regular meetings create a rhythm for the business. For example, a weekly all-hands call (even if the “all hands” is just the three co-founders and any key contractors) ensures everyone is aligned on project timelines and sales pipeline. Project-specific meetings occur at key points: a kickoff meeting at the start of an engagement, weekly or biweekly client status calls during delivery, and a closeout meeting at the end to present results. Additionally, as prime contractor you’ll have frequent one-on-one calls with subcontractors to monitor progress and remove blockers. Expect to interact with clients frequently during engagements – a common cadence is a brief check-in each week to update on progress and address questions, which keeps client confidence high and avoids surprises.

### Project Delivery Cycle:

The lifecycle from sales to delivery to closeout follows a structured path. It typically starts with business development – identifying an opportunity (e.g. a tender on AusTender or a direct approach via your network), then scoping and proposal where you define the project scope, timelines, and pricing in a Statement of Work. Once the contract is won, you conduct a kickoff meeting with the client (introducing the team, confirming scope, timelines, and communication protocols). During delivery/execution, the contracted specialist(s) perform the work while you project-manage: you monitor progress through regular updates and ensure any issues are escalated early. Quality assurance is embedded – e.g. mid-project you might review interim findings or draft reports. Upon completion, you schedule a debrief/final presentation to deliver results (such as a report or assessment findings) and ensure the client’s questions are answered. Finally, you handle project closeout: get formal acceptance from the client, issue the final invoice, pay contractors, and conduct an internal review of lessons learned. This end-to-end cycle can range from a week (for a simple penetration test) to several months (for a complex consulting engagement), but the structured approach remains similar. Clear documentation at each stage (scope documents, meeting minutes, sign-off forms) helps maintain control and set expectations.

### Client Touchpoints:

Throughout an engagement, proactive client communication is key. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Typical touchpoints include an initial kickoff meeting to align on objectives, regular status updates</mark> (often weekly emails or calls summarizing progress, next steps, and any needs from the client), a mid-engagement review (for longer projects) to validate interim findings, and a final presentation/debrief meeting to go through deliverables. For instance, in a 4-week project, you might have a kickoff in week 1, brief email check-ins twice weekly, a mid-point meeting at the end of week 2, and a final presentation in week 4. Government clients especially appreciate structured reporting – providing a status report before each check-in meeting with metrics (e.g. percent complete, any risks/issues) shows professionalism. Regular touchpoints not only keep clients informed but also help manage scope (allowing you to confirm if any new requests are out-of-scope and require change control). Remember that as an Indigenous-owned business, relationship-building is paramount; <mark style="background: #32406AA6;">many Indigenous entrepreneurs favor a relational approach – focusing on trust, collaboration and open information sharing </mark>– which can differentiate your client service. By making communications frequent and personable (while still formal in documentation), you reinforce that relational ethos and ensure the client feels supported throughout the project.

## Indigenous Business Specifics

### Supply Nation Certification & IPP Compliance:

As an Indigenous-owned company (51% Aboriginal ownership), maintaining Supply Nation certification is crucial. This certification is not a one-time event but an ongoing commitment. Supply Nation will verify and audit your business details regularly to ensure you continue to meet the criteria. For initial registration on Indigenous Business Direct, you’ll submit an application with proof of Aboriginal ownership (Confirmation of Aboriginality documents), ABN and ASIC details. The verification team checks that at least 50% of the business is Indigenous-owned, verifies the identified Indigenous owners, and confirms the business is properly registered. Once registered, you can pursue full Supply Nation Certification, which sets a higher bar: you must show at least 51% Indigenous ownership of each share class and that the company is Indigenous-managed and controlled at the executive level. This may involve a site visit or interview to prove that, for example, the Indigenous CEO (Harry) truly has managerial control and isn’t just a figurehead. Annual audits and real-time checks are part of life – Supply Nation receives ASIC updates and may spot-audit if any ownership changes occur.
Day-to-day, this means any decision affecting ownership or control (bringing on new investors, issuing shares, or even certain large business decisions) should be assessed for its impact on your Indigenous ownership percentage and control. To remain eligible under the Commonwealth Indigenous Procurement Policy (IPP), you must stay majority Indigenous-owned; losing that status (even unintentionally) could nullify contracts that were awarded under IPP provisions. Thus, corporate governance decisions always factor in the 51% rule – e.g. if raising capital or forming joint ventures, use structures that preserve Indigenous majority ownership (Supply Nation even has joint venture criteria to guide this). In practice, many Indigenous businesses maintain open communication with Supply Nation, promptly updating any changes to directors or shares. Diligently maintaining your Indigenous certification not only upholds your eligibility for IPP advantages but also reinforces your credibility to clients who seek genuine Indigenous suppliers (helping avoid any perception of “tick-the-box” Indigenous ownership).

### Indigenous Procurement Policy (IPP) Advantages:

Being Supply Nation-certified unlocks powerful business development levers through the IPP. Government buyers have mandatory set-aside (MSA) requirements: for any federal contract between $80,000 and $200,000 (or for any work in remote areas), they must first attempt to procure from an Indigenous business before opening to others. In practice, this means Mokai will get first shot at many mid-size contracts – agencies will search Indigenous Business Direct (the Supply Nation directory) for capable suppliers and invite quotes. To capitalize on this, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">ensure your directory profile is up-to-date with keywords like “cybersecurity, IRAP, Essential Eight” so buyers can find you easily.</mark> Additionally, Exemption 16 of the Commonwealth Procurement Rules allows departments to directly award contracts of any size to an Indigenous SME (bypassing open tender) as long as they demonstrate value for money. This is a huge opportunity – for example, if you network with a department and they trust Mokai, they could invoke Exemption 16 to sole-source a cybersecurity project to you without a competitive tender. Day-to-day, you should remind potential clients of these provisions: part of your sales pitch to government might be educating program managers that they can fast-track a procurement with Mokai thanks to IPP. However, also be <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">prepared to prove value for money (e.g. provide competitive rate cards or past performance</mark>) since buyers must justify the direct award. The IPP also sets annual Indigenous spending targets for agencies (e.g. at least 3% of contracts by number). This means agencies are motivated to contract Indigenous firms, but it’s not automatic – you still need to market and demonstrate capability. The key is to leverage the IPP as a door-opener, then deliver excellent service so that you become a preferred supplier beyond just meeting a quota.

### Community Engagement & Cultural Expectations:

Operating as an Indigenous business carries responsibilities beyond the commercial. There’s an expectation (both from community and sometimes clients) that your business contributes to Indigenous economic development. This can be achieved in various ways in the day-to-day running of Mokai. For instance, you might partner or subcontract other Indigenous businesses for ancillary services (e.g. hiring an Indigenous-owned training company to deliver security awareness workshops as part of a project). Engaging with the Indigenous business community is also important – <mark style="background: #32406AA6;">attending Indigenous business networking events, such as Supply Nation’s annual Connect conference or local Indigenous Chamber of Commerce meetings, helps Mokai stay visible and build relationships. Government agencies and corporates often host meet-and-greet events for Indigenous suppliers;</mark> as CEO you should prioritize these for relationship-building. 

Culturally, Indigenous businesses often put a premium on relationships, trust, and reciprocity in dealings. In practice, you may spend more time getting to know clients and contractors on a personal level, building trust before transactions. This relational way of doing business can reduce transaction costs and lead to more loyal partnerships. It’s wise to mentor and support younger Indigenous talent – for example, offering internships or graduate roles to Indigenous youth interested in cybersecurity. Not only does this fulfill a social mission, it also aligns with many clients’ Reconciliation Action Plan goals and can strengthen your positioning. Balance these community-focused efforts with commercial realities: you still must deliver quality and profit. But in decision-making, <mark style="background: #32406AA6;">you might sometimes accept a slightly lower margin on a project if it allows you to subcontract an Indigenous junior consultant for experience,</mark> thereby meeting both business and community objectives. Many Indigenous entrepreneurs state that “culture and community come first,” with financial gains a secondary focus – Mokai can embody this by always asking how a given decision might create a positive outcome for Indigenous people (employment, skill development, role modeling) alongside business success.

### Maintaining Indigenous Identity in Operations:

On a daily basis, ensure the Indigenous identity of the business remains genuine and visible. This could mean opening meetings with an <mark style="background: #32406AA6;">Acknowledgement of Country, integrating Indigenous art or branding in your marketing, or simply the way you tell your business story to clients (emphasizing your Aboriginal heritage and mission).</mark> However, guard against “black cladding” perceptions – because you have a non-Indigenous co-founder (Jack at 49%), be transparent that while Jack provides technical leadership, the company is Indigenous-owned and led by you. Supply Nation’s audits will quickly detect any arrangement where an Indigenous owner is not truly in control. Thus, decisions like hiring and finances should clearly reside with the Indigenous leadership to satisfy both ethical practice and certification rules. 

By authentically blending Indigenous values (like community focus and knowledge sharing) with professional cybersecurity services, Mokai can differentiate itself. Clients often say that working with an Indigenous supplier brought additional insights or a unique relational approach; lean into that strength. Also consider developing a Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) for Mokai in the future – although you are Indigenous-owned, a RAP can formalize how your company will continue to advance Indigenous outcomes (e.g. commitment to a percentage of profits to Indigenous STEM programs). These efforts signal to clients and the community that Mokai is not just Indigenous in ownership, but in spirit and action.

### Prime Contractor Management

==Contractor Network Vetting:== As a prime contractor relying on a network of specialists, rigorous vetting of contractors is a top priority. Before adding a consultant to Jack’s roster, establish a vetting process: review their resume/CVs for relevant certifications (e.g. ==CISSP, CREST, OSCP),== check references from past engagements, and conduct technical interviews or skills tests if needed. Given the sensitive nature of cybersecurity work, you may also require background checks – at minimum, ensure they have no disqualifying criminal record, and for government projects, verify they are Australian citizens (since many contracts or security clearances require citizenship). It’s wise to have contractors sign an NDA and subcontractor agreement that covers confidentiality, IP ownership (ensuring any work they produce for clients is owned by Mokai or the client as required), and non-compete clauses to prevent them from side-dealing with your clients. This agreement also formalizes their day rate and payment terms. By thoroughly vetting upfront, you reduce the risk of performance or trust issues later on.

### Scheduling and Resource Management:

Managing the scheduling of contractors can feel like a jigsaw puzzle. Maintain a central calendar or project schedule that lists all ongoing projects, their timelines, and which contractor is allocated. Jack (CTO) will likely take charge of matching the right specialist to each job – for example, assigning a cloud security expert for an IRAP assessment on AWS, or a CHECK-certified pen tester for a government penetration test. It’s important to plan buffer time between engagements for contractors, when possible, to accommodate overruns or client delays. One common pain point is contractor availability changing last-minute (e.g. a contractor gets a full-time offer or another project). To ==mitigate this, build a bench of backup contractors or have at least two people in your network with overlapping skillsets for critical domains. Keeping good relationships with your contractor pool is key –== regular communication even when they’re not on a job (just checking in on their availability for the next month) can help you anticipate any scheduling crunch. Some prime contractors use a simple spreadsheet or a cloud PSA (Professional Services Automation) tool to track contractor bookings and availability. As Mokai grows, you might formalize this with a contractor management system, but initially a shared calendar and frequent calls with your network may suffice.

### Communication Between Prime, Subcontractors, and Clients:
Effective communication flow is what makes the prime contractor model work. ==As the prime, Mokai sits in the middle of the info stream. A good practice is to designate a single point of contact for the client (often yourself or Kelly as COO for day-to-day queries),== and internally a single point of contact for each subcontractor (Jack might manage the technical folks). Internally, host a kickoff call with the subcontractor as soon as a project is confirmed – go over the scope, deliverables, timelines, and clarify roles (e.g. who will email the client when). Often, you will prefer that all client communication goes through Mokai to reinforce that you are the prime (clients should see a cohesive team). However, it’s usually beneficial to introduce the contractor as part of your team in client meetings (using titles like “Senior Security Consultant on the project”) so they can speak directly on technical matters. Between you and the subcontractor, maintain daily or near-daily contact during active engagements – this can be a short call or Slack/Teams message to check progress and answer any questions they have about client environment or scope. Also, implement status reporting from subcontractors: for instance, ask for a brief written update each week that you can integrate into your client status report. This keeps you in the loop on work done and any issues, allowing you to proactively manage the client’s expectations. The communication pattern often follows a hub-and-spoke model with you at the hub – ensure the spokes (client and contractor) are never out of sync. For example, if a contractor uncovers a critical issue during a pen test, they inform you first; together you decide how to communicate it to the client (perhaps in an emergency call). By controlling messaging, you maintain consistency and prevent miscommunication. Over time, as trust builds, some subcontractors may interact more freely with clients (especially on long projects), but it’s wise to stay cc’d on key emails and attend major meetings to fulfill your oversight role.

### Performance Management and Quality Control:

One of the biggest challenges as a prime is ensuring quality when you’re not doing the hands-on work. Establish quality assurance steps for every deliverable. For instance, when a contractor finishes a draft report (whether it’s an Essential Eight assessment or a penetration test report), Jack or another qualified team member should peer-review it against your standards. Develop internal templates and checklists – e.g. a report template with your branding and a checklist that covers all sections (executive summary, findings, recommendations, etc.) – and require contractors to use them. This not only ensures consistency but also makes it easier to review. If you spot deficiencies (say the writing is too technical for an exec audience), provide feedback and have the contractor revise before it ever reaches the client. As CEO, you may do a final pass on major deliverables for client readiness.

Additionally, maintain a culture of open feedback with contractors: after each project, do a quick debrief call with the contractor to discuss what went well and what could improve. If a contractor’s performance was subpar (missed deadlines, poor communication, etc.), address it directly. For minor issues, coaching them may resolve it (many contractors appreciate input that helps them secure future work with you).
For serious issues (like a contractor violating security procedures or consistently delivering low-quality work), you must be prepared to terminate their contract or not use them again – your reputation with clients depends on it.
Document any performance problems in case you need to refer back. In ==managing rates, negotiate clear day rates upfront and keep an eye on “margin creep” – if a project requires more days than budgeted due to contractor inefficiency, that eats into your margin.== To handle that, either negotiate a capped fee with contractors (e.g. they commit to deliver for a fixed fee equivalent to X days) or build in buffer days in your pricing to cover overruns. For new contractors, start them on smaller tasks or under close supervision to prove themselves before giving them high-stakes work. By actively managing and supporting your subcontractors, you create a reliable extension of your team. This enables Mokai to deliver consistent quality as a prime, even though the execution is outsourced.

### Handling Contractor Issues:

Despite best vetting, issues will arise – a contractor might get sick at a critical time, or their work might not meet client expectations. ==It’s important to have a contingency plan. Build flexibility into project plans: e.g. schedule deliveries a few days before the absolute deadline to allow rework if needed.== If a contractor becomes unavailable suddenly, you (or Jack) may need to step in to cover tasks temporarily while you find a replacement. ==Always keep a “Plan B” contractor in mind for each engagement== (someone you could call on short notice). In negotiations with contractors, be fair and foster loyalty – if you treat them well (pay on time, reasonable rates, and recognition), they are more likely to prioritize your work and give notice if something comes up.
However, also protect the business: include clauses in subcontracts about termination (so you can quickly release a contractor who is failing to deliver) and non-solicitation (preventing them from poaching your client if they work directly together). If performance issues occur mid-project, sometimes bringing the issue to the client proactively is wise – for example, if a contractor’s initial findings are delayed, you might tell the client “One of our team members had an illness, but we’ve reallocated resources and are adjusting to ensure on-time delivery.” Clients appreciate transparency as long as you demonstrate control of the solution. Ultimately, the goal is that from the client’s perspective, they experience a seamless service from Mokai, even if behind the scenes you are dynamically managing a team of independent specialists.

### Cybersecurity Consulting Operations

#### Engagement Structure & Phases:
Cybersecurity consulting projects generally follow a structured sequence of phases, which you should standardize across your services for consistency. A ==typical engagement structure includes: 1) Scoping and Planning, 2) Kickoff, 3) Execution/Delivery, 4) Reporting, and 5) Debrief/Closeout.== In the scoping phase, you work with the client (often pre-sale or immediately post-contract) to refine the objectives, gather prerequisites (e.g. access for assessments, scope of systems for a pen test), and schedule the work.
Next, the kickoff meeting formally launches the project – here, you introduce the team, confirm scope and timeline, discuss communication channels, and ensure the client’s expectations align with the SOW. During execution, the consultant or team carries out the work (this could be conducting interviews and evidence collection for GRC work, running vulnerability scans and exploits for a pentest, or reviewing configurations for an Essential Eight assessment).
It’s important to manage this phase with periodic check-ins as discussed. As deliverables take shape, move into the reporting phase – analyze the findings and craft the report or documentation. Internal peer review happens here as part of QA. Finally, hold a debrief/closeout stage: deliver the report to the client, often via a presentation or walkthrough meeting, so they fully understand the results and recommendations. ==This is also the time to discuss any next steps or further assistance you could provide (planting seeds for follow-on work).== Many consulting firms formalize these into methodologies; for example, one cybersecurity advisory firm outlines stages like Connect & Scope, Assess, and Debrief in their process, emphasizing a kickoff to determine scope, followed by assessment activities, and concluding with presentation of deliverables and a remediation plan. You can mirror such frameworks to give Mokai a professional and repeatable approach. Each service (Essential 8, IRAP, pen test, etc.) will have unique tasks in execution, but aligning them to this common skeleton makes it easier to manage multiple projects and ensures nothing falls through the cracks.

### Essential Eight Assessments (Workflow & Deliverables):

The Essential Eight is a set of baseline cybersecurity strategies from the Australian Cyber Security Centre, and many government agencies require an Essential Eight maturity assessment. A typical Essential 8 assessment engagement is relatively short and focused. For example, Data#3 offers a 5-day Essential Eight Assessment engagement, with up to 2 days on-site reviewing the client’s environment.

#### Mokai’s approach could be:

##### Day 1 –
Kickoff and documentation gathering (policies, system inventories, configurations related to the eight controls).

##### Days 2-3 – Assessment and evidence review:

your contractor will assess each of the eight strategies (Application Control, Patch Applications, Configure Macros, User Application Hardening, Restrict Admin Privileges, Patch Operating Systems, Multi-Factor Authentication, Regular Backups) against the ACSC’s maturity model. This might involve interviewing IT staff (to understand processes like patch management timelines), running scripts or vulnerability scans (to validate patch levels or application whitelisting in place), and checking settings (like Group Policy for Office macro settings).

##### Day 4 – Analysis and report drafting:

summarizing the maturity level achieved (Levels 0 through 3) for each of the eight, with evidence and observations.

##### Day 5 – Debrief and recommendations:

presenting the findings to the client, usually including a ==heat-map or scorecard== of their maturity levels and a list of recommendations to uplift each control. Deliverables typically include an ==Essential Eight Assessment Report== that lists the current maturity level for each control, evidence observed, and what is needed to reach the next level.
The ACSC provides an assessment guide and even test plans for Essential Eight, which your team can leverage to ensure the assessment is thorough. The timeline can be adjusted based on organization size, but generally these are quick turn-around engagements. Ensure that in the report you clearly explain technical measures in plain language for executives – e.g. instead of just “Maturity Level 1 for Application Control,” say “Application Whitelisting is partially implemented (Level 1) – we found not all servers enforce whitelisting, which means unapproved software could run. To reach Level 2, XYZ steps are needed.” This service is high in demand as agencies seek to benchmark themselves, and by delivering clear, actionable reports, Mokai can secure repeat business for annual reassessments or remediation projects.

##### IRAP Assessments (Process & Timeline):

IRAP (Information Security Registered Assessors Program) assessments are formal security assessments for systems handling government data, aligned with the Australian Government’s ISM (Information Security Manual). IRAP engagements are more complex and lengthy than an Essential 8 review. They involve a certified IRAP assessor going through a structured process to evaluate a system’s security controls and its compliance with the ISM and potentially the Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF). The typical IRAP process has four phases:

##### Phase 1: Planning and Preparation – Develop the Assessment Plan.

You’ll coordinate with the client to outline the scope (which system or systems, what classification of data, etc.), the timeframe, and required resources. The IRAP assessor also files required notifications (like a Conflict of Interest declaration to ASD). In this phase, you schedule interviews, arrange site visits, and ensure the client provides documentation (system architecture, security policies, risk assessments, etc.).

##### Phase 2: Scope Validation – The assessor validates the system boundary and understanding:

confirming exactly which infrastructure and data flows are in scope, and the security classification of the system. This may involve reviewing network diagrams and data categorizations. Any changes in scope are agreed here (it’s important to lock down scope to avoid scope creep in an IRAP job).

##### Phase 3: Assessment (Control Testing) – The assessor examines the implementation of security controls.
This is the core of the engagement and can take several weeks or months. It includes documentation review (policies, procedures, previous audit reports), interviews with system owners and administrators, and technical verification (checking configurations, maybe technical testing if in scope). The assessor evaluates whether controls are both appropriately designed and operating effectively. For each control in the ISM relevant to the system, they will mark it as Implemented, Partially, or Not Implemented, and note any residual risks.

##### Phase 4: Reporting – The assessor compiles an IRAP Assessment Report and a Security Controls Matrix.

The report details the scope, how the assessment was conducted, which controls were tested, and findings for each (areas of non-compliance, risks, etc.). The Security Control Matrix is a spreadsheet or table listing every applicable ISM control and the assessor’s observation on its status. This deliverable is given to the client (and often to the accrediting authority) and forms the basis for the client’s remediation plan or accreditation decision.


The timeline for an IRAP assessment can range widely from 2 to 6 months. Factors include the system size/complexity, how prepared the client is (if their documentation is a mess, it takes longer), and the classification level (Protected or higher usually means more controls to assess). For example, a small system at Unclassified might be assessed in 6-8 weeks, whereas a large Protected system could easily take 4-6 months by the time reporting is finalized. As Mokai, you may partner with an accredited IRAP assessor (since Jack is assembling a specialist network, ensure some IRAP assessors are in it).
Your role in an IRAP engagement, if not as the assessor, could be project managing the process and doing a pre-review (some firms do an “IRAP readiness” consultancy first to identify gaps before the formal assessment). Ensure that the assessor remains truly independent in their findings (integrity is critical in IRAP), but you can assist the client in remediation advice afterwards. IRAP assessments are detail-heavy; good practice is to maintain an evidence register (mapping each control to evidence collected).
The outcome of an IRAP (the report) often leads to a remediation phase – which is another opportunity for Mokai to provide services (e.g. help implement the fixes needed to meet ISM controls). It’s worth noting that under ISM guidance, systems should be re-assessed every two years, meaning recurring work if you perform well. The key to success is meticulous organization, clear communication with the client’s security and IT teams, and producing a report that is both comprehensive and digestible by the agency’s Authorising Officer (executive who will read the summary).

### Penetration Testing Projects:

Penetration testing is a staple offering in cybersecurity consulting and tends to have a fast-paced, technical workflow. A typical penetration test engagement might last a few weeks end-to-end. According to industry guidelines, the timeline breaks down into Planning, Execution, Analysis/Reporting, and Presentation. For example, Triaxiom Security notes that a typical pen test project takes about 4–6 weeks from planning to final report:

##### Planning (2–3 weeks):

This includes the contracting and scoping steps. You’ll work with the client to define the scope (which networks, applications, or domains are in scope; any exclusions; test windows), get legal authorization to hack those systems (Rules of Engagement document signed), and schedule the test period. If external testing, ensure IP addresses are whitelisted. If the client requires a specific window (e.g. only after-hours testing), incorporate that. Use this time to also prepare a Test Plan and brief the assigned ethical hacker on any environment specifics.

##### Execution (1–2 weeks):

The active testing phase. The pentester will perform reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, exploitation attempts, and post-exploitation to see what access they can gain. They’ll likely follow a methodology (e.g. OSINT → scanning → exploitation → lateral movement, etc.). Ensure that daily updates are provided (some clients want daily interim reports of any critical findings). If a critical vulnerability is found (e.g. an open RDP server with no password), there should be an agreed process to notify the client immediately rather than waiting till the final report, so they can fix it. As the prime, monitor progress – perhaps a midpoint check-in to see if more time is needed.

Analysis & Documentation (about 1 week): Once testing is concluded, the pentester analyzes the data (logs, screenshots, tool outputs) and writes the Penetration Test Report. This report should include an executive summary (key risks in plain English), technical details of findings (each vulnerability with evidence, impact, likelihood), and remediation recommendations. Mokai’s QA process should kick in here: review the draft report for clarity, severity ratings consistency, and that it meets the client’s expectations set in scope. Often you’ll iterate a bit with the tester to refine wording or include additional context that the client’s stakeholders will need.

Presentation of Findings (1 day meeting): Schedule a meeting with the client’s technical team and possibly executives to go through the findings. The pentester (or Jack/you) presents each major finding, its impact, and suggested fix. Be prepared to answer questions or even demonstrate certain exploits (in a safe manner). The goal is to ensure the client fully understands the risks and next steps. After this, the engagement formally closes, though many clients will come back with questions as they work on fixes. It’s good practice to include a remediation verification if possible – e.g. offer to retest the high-risk issues once they’re patched (sometimes included in scope or as a small extra effort).


In managing pen test projects, one challenge is scope creep – sometimes during testing you discover another system that seems vulnerable but wasn’t in scope. You must then discuss with the client whether to expand scope (and adjust costs or schedule) or leave it. Another challenge is balancing thorough testing with time constraints. A strong methodology and skilled tester help ensure the client gets maximum value within the agreed time. Document all actions taken (for your own records and in case of any issues or if client requests specifics). Security of data is crucial too: treat any data obtained during the test (credentials, personal info, etc.) with strict confidentiality and destroy or return it after the engagement as per contract. By following a well-defined process and maintaining communication, Mokai can execute penetration tests efficiently, typically wrapping up within a few weeks from kickoff to final report, and deliver actionable results.

##### Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) Consulting:

GRC projects might include activities like developing security policies, conducting risk assessments, compliance gap analyses (against standards like ISO 27001 or NSW Cyber Security Policy), or building governance frameworks. These engagements are often more collaborative and document-heavy. A typical risk assessment consulting project, for example, could run 4–8 weeks and involve: initial scoping and framework selection (determine if using ISO 31000 process or other methodology), then workshops/interviews with stakeholders to identify risks (e.g. hosting a workshop with department heads to brainstorm cyber risks), then documentation review (look at existing risk registers, incident reports, etc.), followed by analysis to produce a risk register with risk ratings. The deliverable might be a Risk Assessment Report and updated Risk Register, along with a treatment plan. Similarly, a policy development project might involve gathering requirements (compliance obligations, best practices), drafting policies (like an Acceptable Use Policy, Incident Response Plan), and iterating with client feedback before finalizing and maybe even conducting a training session on the new policies. The workflow always begins with understanding the client’s current state and requirements, then a mix of interviews and document creation, and ends with a deliverable that the client will implement.

For Essential Eight maturity uplift engagements (beyond just assessment), you might be engaged to help implement improvements: that could entail creating a roadmap where each of the eight controls gets a set of actions, and perhaps leading specific improvements (like deploying an application whitelisting solution or tightening admin privilege processes). Those become more project-management oriented, potentially spanning several months with multiple milestones.

In all GRC work, client involvement is heavy – you’ll be setting up many meetings to get information and validate approaches. One tip is to have a steering committee or point of contact at the client who helps coordinate interviews and provides needed documents. Quality in GRC deliverables is paramount since these often go to audit committees or regulators. Adopting established frameworks ensures credibility (e.g. use ISO 27002 as a reference if designing a controls framework, or NIST CSF for a maturity model). The timeline for GRC projects can vary a lot: a straightforward policy writing job might be 2-3 weeks, while a full security program development could be 6+ months. It’s important to set clear interim deliverables (for example, a draft policy set by week 2, review by week 3, final by week 4) to keep progress measurable.

### Project Management Tools and Techniques:

Given Mokai’s small size, formal PM tools might be simple (spreadsheets, shared documents), but don’t shy from instituting them. A basic project plan for each engagement, with tasks, owners, and due dates, will help coordinate between you, the contractor, and the client. Additionally, consider using a ticketing or task tracking system (even Trello or Asana) for internal tracking of tasks on larger projects. Since Jack oversees technical delivery, he can use these tools to manage contractors’ tasks and you can monitor overall progress. The goal is to maintain a handle on multiple concurrent engagements without anything falling behind schedule.

By standardizing engagement processes and tailoring them slightly for each service line, Mokai can deliver professional outcomes across the board. Each type of service (be it a tech-heavy pentest or a process-focused GRC review) will produce documentation and insights that the client relies on, so polishing your methodology and deliverables in these early days will set a strong foundation for the company’s reputation.

## Government Contracting

AusTender Monitoring and Opportunity Identification: A significant portion of Mokai’s target market is government, so understanding and leveraging government procurement processes is essential. AusTender (the Commonwealth Government’s tender portal) will be a daily touchpoint. Set up AusTender alerts for relevant keywords (e.g. “cyber security”, “penetration test”, “IRAP”, etc.) and categories (there are specific UNSPSC codes for IT Security Consulting).
This way, whenever a new Approach to Market (ATM) is published matching those, you get an email. It’s also useful to regularly check Annual Procurement Plans on AusTender, which outline what each agency expects to buy in the coming year – this can help you anticipate tenders. Many states have their own tender sites (NSW eTender, Victorian tenders VIC, etc.), and the Indigenous Business directories for states.

Since you are Supply Nation certified, also keep an eye out for the Mandatory Set-Aside opportunities: if an ATM falls in the $80k–$200k range and is in your field, remember the agency should have first looked for an Indigenous supplier. If you see an open tender in that range for cyber services, it could mean either they didn’t find an Indigenous supplier or perhaps they are fulfilling the requirement by including an Indigenous business in the process.
You could still bid, highlighting your Indigenous status and gently reminding them in the response that under IPP you fulfill the criteria. Additionally, network outside AusTender: join lists like the Digital Marketplace (a federal panel for digital services) or various panel arrangements where possible (more on panels below). Some smaller opportunities (like departmental RFQs under panel arrangements) may not be publicly visible on AusTender once you’re on those panels – they come via email to panel members. As CEO, consider dedicating a set time each week (e.g. every Monday morning) to review upcoming tenders and assign pursuit responsibilities (perhaps you lead on some, Kelly on others). Government contracting is deadline-driven (strict closing dates on tenders), so maintain a calendar of these and work backwards to plan proposal work.

#### Panel Membership Management:

Government panels (standing offer arrangements or supplier lists) are common in Australia. Mokai, as a small and new player, should identify key panels that align with your services – for example, the Digital Marketplace Panel for ICT services, the Defence ICT Security Services Panel (if one exists), various department-specific panels (some departments have panels for professional services or cyber). To join a panel, typically an open tender or refresh opportunity is issued. Responding to get on a panel can be a lighter-weight submission than a full contract bid, but it still requires demonstrating capability and value.

##### Once on a panel, managing that status involves a few tasks:
keeping your company details updated with the panel manager (if you get new insurance or your contact person changes, update it), monitoring any refreshes (some panels allow new members every 1-2 years – although you’re already in, refresh could be to update service categories or rates).
Also, critically, being on a panel does not guarantee work – you still have to market yourself. So reach out to agencies that use the panel, let them know you’re on it (maybe through capability statements or networking).
Some panels require periodic reporting of sales or compliance; be sure to comply with those (e.g. quarterly sales reports or confirming SME status annually). If the panel has an internal portal (like the Department of Defence might have a secure portal for RFQs), log in frequently or set notifications so you don’t miss any requests for quote.

Panel contracts often have set rates or rate caps – ensure your pricing remains competitive under those. There’s also a benefit under some panels for Indigenous or small businesses – for example, the Management Advisory Services (MAS) Panel and People Panel require that for each quote, at least one SME is invited, and they even allow a flexibility allowance for agencies to procure a small percentage off-panel from Indigenous SMEs.
This means even if you’re not on a particular panel, agencies could still include you. Knowing these rules (often buried in panel guidelines) lets you advise potential clients: “Even if we’re not on your panel, you can utilize the 5% flexibility to engage us as an Indigenous supplier”.

### Tender Response Workflows:

When a promising tender or RFQ appears, a disciplined response process is needed. Typically, government tenders have a defined format (response schedules to fill out). The steps might be:

1. Bid/No-Bid Decision (Day 1-2): Quickly review the opportunity – scope, contract value, due date, and whether IPP applies. Evaluate if Mokai can meet the requirements (skills, capacity) and if the odds justify the effort. If it’s a go, immediately register interest (via AusTender) to get Q&A updates and download all documents.


2. Team Kickoff (Day 2): Convene your proposal team (maybe just you and Kelly, plus Jack for technical input). Read the tender in detail and extract key requirements and evaluation criteria. Create a compliance checklist listing every question or requirement that must be addressed. Assign responsibilities (e.g. Jack drafts the methodology/technical approach, Kelly compiles company info and Indigenous engagement section, you draft executive summary, etc.).


3. Outline & Content Gathering (Week 1): Gather all needed information early. This may include past project descriptions to use as case studies, resumes of contractors you plan to propose (ensure you have their permission and they are actually available if you win), and your Indigenous certifications (often tenders ask for proof of Supply Nation registration or an Indigenous procurement form). If the tender has a Q&A period, submit any clarification questions by the deadline. Also line up any required attachments (insurance certificates, financial statements if required, etc.) – note, many government tenders will require evidence of your insurance coverage and perhaps quality certifications. Ensure those are ready (e.g., Professional Indemnity, Public Liability, Workers Comp certificates).


4. Drafting (Week 2-3): Write the response according to the format requested. Focus on demonstrating value for money and compliance. Since Mokai has Indigenous status, weave that into your response where appropriate: e.g. in the Capability section, mention how you bring both technical expertise and the benefit of fulfilling the client’s Indigenous procurement objectives. However, ensure you fully address technical criteria – do not rely solely on Indigenous status. Use the evaluation criteria as headings or a guide – evaluators often score based on those. For example, if criteria are “Understanding of Requirements”, “Methodology”, “Experience”, and “Pricing”, structure your response to clearly cover each. Provide specific examples of past work (even if Mokai is new, you and Jack can reference work you personally have done). If it’s an open tender, expect to write quite a bit; if it’s an RFQ to panel members, sometimes a shorter response or just a quote and a brief capability statement is needed.


5. Review and Compliance Check (Week 3-4): Always do an internal red-team review if possible – essentially, critically read the response as if you’re the evaluator. Check that every question is answered, every form filled, no instructions ignored (government buyers can be sticklers for format). Common pitfalls to avoid: missing the submission deadline (even by minutes – AusTender will close), exceeding page limits, or not attaching a signed declaration. Use the checklist you made to do a final compliance tick-off.


6. Submission (End of Week 4 or as per deadline): Submit via the required channel (often electronically through AusTender). Aim to submit a day early if possible, to buffer against technical issues. After submission, note the expected evaluation timeline. Government evaluations can take weeks to months. In the interim, keep pursuing other leads.


7. Follow-up & Debrief: If you win, great – move to contracting. If not, always request a debrief from the agency. They will usually provide feedback on where your tender fell short. This insight is gold for improving future proposals (e.g. maybe your pricing was high, or your methodology detail was weak compared to others). Keep a record of win/loss reasons.



Over time, you can build a proposal content library – snippets about Mokai’s experience, project methodologies, bios of team members – to reuse in future bids and save time. Ensure any claims in proposals are truthful and you can back them up if asked. Particularly for government, avoid overpromising resources you don’t actually have; it’s better to be clear that you’ll source specialist contractors (and name their qualifications) than pretend you have 10 staff in-house. Transparency with a plan is viewed better than an overstated claim. Lastly, be mindful of contractual terms in tenders – many RFTs include draft contract terms; review them (or get legal advice if complex) for any showstoppers (e.g. liability caps, IP ownership). Sometimes you can flag minor exceptions or clarifications in your response, but big exceptions might make your bid non-compliant. Generally, SMEs accept standard government terms which usually include requirements like maintaining certain insurances, complying with security provisions, etc., which you should already be prepared for.

#### Mandatory Set-Aside & Exemption 16 Usage:

We touched on IPP rules, but practically in contracting: if an RFQ comes to you under the Mandatory Set-Aside (i.e., you’re being asked for a quote because of IPP), know that the buyer must purchase from an Indigenous business if you can meet requirements and value for money. This means in your quote you should directly address value for money – explicitly state how your pricing is competitive and the outcomes will meet their needs.

The buyer may be getting multiple Indigenous quotes in parallel, so you still have competition (just limited to Indigenous suppliers). With Exemption 16, if you’re in a position to influence or if a department shows interest, you might help them justify value: provide case studies of successful similar projects (showing capability and low risk), and perhaps offer a lean pricing or added value (like a follow-up workshop included) to make the sole-source decision easy to defend.

Always keep documentation for value for money – e.g., if you know market rates for a service, you might mention “Our rate of $X/day is in line or below industry benchmarks, ensuring the Commonwealth achieves value for money.” This not only helps the client’s procurement file, but also signals you understand their obligations.

#### Contract Negotiation & Compliance:

When it comes to formalizing contracts with government, typically they will issue their standard contract for you to sign (for example, the Commonwealth Contracting Suite for simpler procurements, or a bespoke contract for larger ones). There is usually limited room to negotiate terms, especially for smaller contracts.

However, you should review key terms: ensure you can meet the insurance requirements (often specified in the tender – e.g. $5 million Professional Indemnity, $10 million Public Liability, etc.); ensure the delivery timeline and milestones in the contract match what you proposed; check liability clauses (most government contracts cap supplier liability to some multiple of contract value or a fixed amount – confirm it’s reasonable and within your insurance cover). Intellectual Property is another area – many government contracts state the agency will own IP in deliverables.

If you have any pre-existing IP (like Mokai’s proprietary assessment toolkit), mark it as such to retain ownership, giving the client a license. For the most part, government terms are standard and meant to be fair (e.g. there’s usually a disputes process, payment terms like net 30 days, etc.). Note that Commonwealth contracts often include flow-down obligations like privacy requirements (you might need to handle personal information under the Privacy Act) and security provisions (if the work is sensitive, contract may require you to get relevant security clearances for personnel or follow certain information handling rules). Be prepared to comply – for example, have a plan for storing any government data securely and return or destroy it after the project as required.

Negotiating may be more feasible with enterprise clients or subcontract agreements, but with government, you mostly adhere to their terms. One area you can negotiate is the schedule or payment milestones. If you prefer monthly billing on a long project, you can propose that in your response or during contract finalization. Ensure the contract clearly states the acceptance criteria for deliverables (so you know when you’ve fulfilled obligations and can invoice). Also confirm any contractor confidentiality or conflict of interest clauses – contractors should be covered under your agreement, but sometimes the government wants individual acknowledgments or conflict declarations from each team member. Facilitate that as needed.

Finally, once a contract is signed, comply meticulously with contract management requirements. Deliver reports on time, meet any reporting requirements (some contracts require progress reports at set intervals), and communicate any potential variance early. Government clients appreciate proactive contract management – it builds trust and positions you well for extensions or follow-on work. If issues arise, use the contract’s mechanisms (for example, if scope is being exceeded, seek a contract variation or at least written direction so you’re covered to invoice the extra work). Keep records of all communications and changes; government contracts can be very documentation-heavy if there’s a dispute, so maintaining that paper trail is crucial.

It may feel procedural, but once your internal processes align (tender tracking, proposal writing, contract compliance), it becomes a repeatable engine for growth in the government arena.

### Financial Operations

##### Cash Flow Management:
In a services-first business using subcontractors, cash flow timing can be a make-or-break factor. A common scenario is that you must pay your contractors on a shorter term than you receive payment from the client. Government clients typically pay on Net 30-day terms (30 days from invoice, sometimes from end of month). Some government contracts, as part of SME initiatives, might pay faster (the Commonwealth has a policy to pay SMEs within 20 days). Regardless, you often have a gap. If your contractor invoices you upon finishing their work, they may expect payment in, say, 14 days. If the client then pays you on day 30, you’re fronting that cash for a couple of weeks. To manage this, try to align payment terms when possible: you can negotiate with contractors to be paid upon (or shortly after) Mokai’s receipt of payment from the client. In fact, some subcontract agreements include a “pay-when-paid” clause (though legally in Australia these clauses can be void in some construction contexts, they are sometimes used in consulting). A balanced approach is offering contractors something like Net 30 as well – many independent contractors are fine with 30 days if they trust you to pay promptly. Always communicate and pay on time or early – your reputation with contractors matters for loyalty.

Maintain a cash buffer in your account for at least one cycle of payments. For example, if you have to pay a contractor $50k for a project and wait 30 days for the same $50k from the client, you need that $50k available. If not, consider financing options: invoice financing (factoring) is one, where a finance company pays you most of the invoice value upfront and takes a small cut when the client pays. However, factoring government invoices is usually easier due to their reliability, but still costs money. Alternatively, ensure your billing schedule on projects supports cash flow – for longer projects, break it into milestones (e.g. 50% on kickoff, 50% on completion) so you’re not waiting too long to invoice. On very short projects (2-3 weeks), you might invoice 100% at the end, which is fine. But on, say, a 3-month project, invoice monthly or at key deliverables. Government clients won’t usually prepay, but they accept milestone billing if proposed.

#### Margin Management (Services vs Products):

Mokai has two revenue streams – service contracts and product reselling – each with different margin profiles. Services (consulting projects) generally yield higher gross margins. You mentioned targeting 20-40% margin on services, which is reasonable. This means if a contractor’s day rate to you is $800, you might charge the client $1,000–$1,300 for that resource, for example. The exact margin can vary by project and how specialized the skill is (highly specialized skills you might mark up less percentage-wise to stay competitive on rate). Track each project’s gross margin by comparing what you bill vs. what you pay out to contractors – aim for at least that 20% on every job to cover overhead (insurance, accounting, your salaries, etc.) and profit. Products (reselling software licenses or hardware) have lower margins, often around 10-15% as you noted. Some vendor products might even be sub-10% margin for resellers unless you reach volume targets. Carefully manage product quotes: ensure you get the best distributor pricing (register deals with vendors if possible to get extra discount), and factor in all costs (shipping, import duties if any, etc.) when calculating margin. Because product margins are slim, the strategy is often to use product sales to open doors or complement services rather than as a standalone profit driver. For instance, you might resell a security software license at 10% margin, but bundle it with a configuration service that has 30% margin, leading to a healthy blended outcome.

Monitor discounting and scope creep impact on margins. If a client pushes for a discount, it comes straight out of your margin. It’s often better to add value (extra training session, extended support) than to cut price, to preserve margin. Another aspect: track utilization of contractors. If you commit to pay a contractor a minimum amount (e.g. a monthly retainer), ensure you have work to utilize that or it erodes margin. Since most of your contractors will likely be paid per day of work, you have flexibility, but keep an eye on any fixed costs.

#### Working Capital for Product Reselling:
Selling hardware/software can involve large sums and timing issues. Often you’ll need to order from a distributor, who might give you 30-day payment terms as well if you have an account. Ideally, align the client’s payment with the distributor’s invoice. For example, if you deliver a $100k firewall to a client, you might get invoiced by your supplier payable in 30 days. If the client pays you in 30 days, you pass it through – margin aside. However, what if the client’s payment delays? You may have to pay the distributor first to avoid account holds. It’s wise to establish a credit line or ensure you have enough reserve to float large product purchases. Some strategies to reduce working capital strain: request a client pre-payment or deposit for costly product orders (not uncommon for hardware – e.g. 50% upfront, especially if it’s a custom order). Or use the client’s procurement channels – occasionally, you can arrange for the distributor to invoice the client directly with you getting a cut, but this is rare in straightforward resale. More simply, tightly manage the timing: place orders in a way that you receive and can invoice the client immediately on delivery. If you become an authorized reseller of certain vendors, watch out for rebate programs – some vendors rebate a few percent for hitting quarterly targets, which can boost your effective margin but also means you have to front money and await the rebate later.

Also consider currency fluctuations if you’re importing products or licenses priced in USD – sudden changes can eat your margin, so for big deals, lock in currency rates or have a buffer. Working capital also extends to carrying inventory: It’s usually best not to hold inventory as a small firm; dropship or just-in-time ordering is safer. Only buy stock if you have a committed customer order.

#### Invoicing Cycles & Payment Terms:

Establish a clear invoicing process. For services, you might invoice upon milestones or monthly. For products, invoice upon delivery (or in milestone for big multi-deliverable orders). Ensure your invoices meet all the client’s requirements to avoid delays (e.g. include purchase order number, correct entity name, breakdown including GST, etc.). Government invoices often must be submitted via a portal or to a specific AP email. Set your terms on invoices (e.g. “Payment due 30 days from invoice date”) but be aware government will stick to their policy (if SME, could be 20 days; if not, usually 30). Private enterprises might negotiate longer (some large companies quietly push to 45 or 60 days – try to resist anything beyond 30 if you can, or adjust pricing if they insist, since that’s effectively financing cost for you).

Consider staggering invoicing if you have multiple projects ending around the same time – a bunch of large invoices at once sounds nice for revenue, but remember that means a bunch of contractor payments likely due around the same window. It could be fine, but just manage accordingly.

Implement a tracking system for receivables. Even a simple spreadsheet that lists invoices sent, due date, and payment status will help you stay on top of who owes what. If a payment is overdue, don’t hesitate to politely follow up the day after it’s late; SMEs should be paid on time (the Department of Finance has FAQs where small businesses can find recourse if not paid promptly). The federal government has a policy of paying interest on late payments to small businesses – know this, so if a department is significantly late, you can claim that interest (though maintaining relationship often means you’d only do so if it’s really egregious).

#### Overheads and Hidden Costs:

As you start operating, a number of costs beyond just wages/contractor fees will accrue. Insurance premiums are a big one – Professional Indemnity insurance for a cyber consultancy could be several thousands per year (depending on coverage, often required $2M or $5M cover) and Public Liability another chunk. Cyber insurance for your own firm might also be wise (and sometimes clients ask if you have it). Then there are staff on-costs for your one employee (Kelly): superannuation (currently 11% of salary in 2025), annual leave accruals, possibly workers compensation insurance (which is compulsory for employees). Don’t forget Payroll Tax if you grow your wage bill – each state has thresholds. For example, in NSW the annual tax-free threshold is $1.2 million of wages, with a tax of 5.45% on wages above that. When starting out with one or two staff you’ll be under that, but as you scale and maybe hire more, crossing that threshold can sneak up and hit your costs significantly. Also note that contractor payments generally aren’t counted for payroll tax unless those contractors are really working like employees (rules vary, but be mindful if someone is essentially full-time for you, the state might deem them under payroll tax).

#### Other often-forgotten costs:
GST – while it’s pass-through (you charge 10% GST to clients, pay 10% on many expenses and remit the difference), you need to manage those cash flows and reporting quarterly via BAS (Business Activity Statement). Office expenses – even if you largely work from home or a small office, things like IT equipment for yourself and Kelly, software subscriptions (for example, a PM tool, an accounting software like Xero, maybe a proposal software, etc.) and travel costs for meetings or conferences. Marketing costs – e.g. developing a website, design for brochures, attending events (sponsoring a booth at a conference or just tickets) should be budgeted. Also, if you plan to get any certifications (ISO 9001 for quality, ISO 27001 for your own security, etc.), those have audit costs annually.

Keep a close eye on profitability per project and overall. A simple practice: for each project, do a mini P&L – revenue from client, less contractor cost, less any direct expenses (travel, special tools) – to see the gross profit. Then ensure that gross profit covers a portion of overhead. In the first year, overhead might be low (no office rent maybe), but as CEO you likely draw a salary which is part of overhead along with Kelly’s salary. As you add staff or invest in capability, overhead grows, so your target margin per project might need to grow or volume of work needs to increase.

A good financial habit is to maintain a cash flow forecast – even a 12-week rolling spreadsheet of expected cash in and out – so you can anticipate any crunch. If you see a gap (say two big contracts ending and payments not coming until 30+ days later, but contractor invoices due sooner), you can arrange short-term financing or negotiate timing in advance. Also leverage any government incentives for SMEs – for instance, R&D tax incentives if you ever develop some innovative tech, or state government small business grants, etc. Being Indigenous-owned, there might be specific grants or loans (Indigenous Business Australia offers some support) – worth exploring for boosting working capital or funding growth, especially since you mentioned possibly product reselling (which can need upfront capital).

> [!summary]
>
> In summary, treat financial operations as importantly as service delivery. Many profitable-on-paper consultancies have failed due to cash flow mismanagement. By invoicing promptly, controlling costs, and planning for those low-margin product sales and timing differences, Mokai will build a healthy financial base. Remember that growth will demand more working capital (more projects in flight means more contractors to pay before money comes in), so reinvesting early profits into a cash buffer is wise. Aim to have enough reserves to cover at least 2-3 months of expenses with no revenue – that cushion is crucial in the lumpy world of consulting income.

### Business Development & Sales

#### Lead Generation (Government & Enterprise):

Building a pipeline of opportunities will require a multi-pronged approach. For government leads, as discussed, monitoring AusTender and participating in panels is one way. But many opportunities, especially smaller ones, come through relationships and visibility. Make sure Mokai is listed in all relevant supplier directories: aside from Supply Nation, consider the NSW Indigenous Business Directory if targeting state contracts, and any industry-specific lists (e.g. some departments maintain a list of pre-qualified IRAP assessors or similar – get on those radars through networking). Attend government-sponsored business events, such as “Meet the Buyer” events or procurement information sessions (these are sometimes run by large agencies or by Supply Nation Connect). Use these to directly meet procurement officers or project managers and introduce Mokai’s capabilities. For enterprise (corporate) clients, classic networking and marketing will apply. Leverage any existing contacts you have in banks, utilities, etc. LinkedIn can be powerful: regularly post thought leadership content (e.g. a short article on “Top 5 Essential Eight Quick Wins”), which both demonstrates expertise and subtly markets your services. Connect with corporate CISOs and procurement folks, especially those known to have Reconciliation Action Plans (many big corporates have targets for engaging Indigenous suppliers as part of their RAP – these are your likely prospects).

Vendor partnerships can also feed leads – since you plan to resell technology, if you become an authorized partner of a cybersecurity vendor, they might pass you leads for services. For example, if you resell a particular cloud security solution, the vendor might involve you when their clients need deployment services or assessments. Cultivate good relationships with vendor account managers. Possibly join the vendor’s partner program that often has a directory – being the only Indigenous partner in a space can be a differentiator they'll highlight.

Another channel is referrals from larger firms. Ironically, sometimes the big consulting firms or primes need an Indigenous subcontractor for either meeting IPP or RAP commitments. While you ultimately want to prime, don’t dismiss sub work if it’s strategic. For instance, a Big 4 consulting firm might bring you in as the Supply Nation-certified sub on a large project (maybe you provide a specialist or take a small work package). That gives experience and revenue. Just be cautious to preserve your own brand and ensure you get credit/visibility (sometimes the big firm might “white-label” your work; try to negotiate permission to mention the project in your credentials later).

Maintain a sales pipeline tracker (could be as simple as an Excel or a CRM system if you prefer). List all potential leads, their stage (e.g. prospect, proposal submitted, etc.), value, and next action. This helps you forecast and also ensure you’re regularly touching each lead (e.g. if a procurement is delayed 3 months, set a reminder to follow up). As CEO, a substantial portion of your time will be business development, so have a routine: e.g. each week aim to reach out to X new contacts, attend at least one networking event a month, etc., to keep leads flowing.

#### Relationship Building with Procurement and Decision-Makers:

Government procurement officers and corporate procurement managers are gatekeepers. Building a good reputation with them can smooth the path to contracts. In practical terms: always be professional and responsive in any interaction (e.g. if a procurement officer asks a clarification question during a tender, respond clearly and promptly). When you meet them at events, don’t just pitch – listen to what their agency needs, the challenges they face in finding suppliers, etc. By understanding their pain points, you can tailor your approach (for example, if an agency is worried about small suppliers’ capacity, you can highlight your network of 20 specialist contractors and successful delivery track record).

#### Leverage the Indigenous business community aspects:

many procurement people attend Supply Nation events or Indigenous business trade fairs to meet potential suppliers. Ensure Mokai is present and that you (Harry) as an Indigenous CEO connect personally – people do remember faces and stories more than company names. Share the story of Mokai, your mission to bring Indigenous excellence to cybersecurity – this makes you memorable and frames engaging you as a positive for their procurement goals beyond just another vendor.

For enterprise, relationship-building may involve more layers – you need to connect with technical buyers (CIOs, CISOs) and the procurement departments. Going through the IT and security professional networks (like attending Australian Information Security Association (AISA) meetings or local cyber meetups) can help meet CISOs. When you find a champion in a company (say a CISO who is interested in giving Mokai a chance), they can help navigate their procurement. Also use corporate channels: many large companies have supplier diversity managers or Indigenous liaison managers – find out who, introduce Mokai to them. They can sometimes plug you into opportunities internally.

Consistency and trust are key. As Dr. Jarrett’s research highlighted, strong personal relationships and trust are top factors in successful Indigenous business engagements. So invest time in follow-ups: if you meet someone, follow up with an email or LinkedIn message thanking them, maybe share a bit more info about your services. Even if there’s no immediate opportunity, these contacts can bear fruit later when something comes up and they remember you.

#### Proposal Development & Sales Collateral:

Ensure you have basic sales materials ready: a capability statement (a 2-4 page brochure with overview of Mokai, services, team bios, past performance or case studies, and your Indigenous credentials). Use this when approaching new clients – it can be attached to introduction emails or given in meetings. Also have a polished website that mirrors this info; government buyers often do a quick due diligence search on new suppliers, so having a professional website that clearly states you are Indigenous-owned and outlines your offerings is beneficial.

When developing specific proposals (outside formal tenders too), e.g. a client informally asks for a quote or a proposal for a project, treat it with similar rigor: gather requirements, clarify the scope in writing, propose a solution, timeline, and price. Emphasize Mokai’s unique value: “We bring a robust network of cyber specialists while being a nimble Indigenous-owned firm – you get Big-4 expertise with small-firm agility and the cultural value of supporting Indigenous business.” Back that up with any relevant case study or the team’s certifications.

#### Win/Loss Analysis & Continuous Improvement:

Every significant proposal or tender should be reviewed afterward. If you win, great – analyze why: Did the client mention any particular reason? (Ask in kickoff, “by the way, what tipped the scale in our favor?” They might say price, or Indigenous status, or a strong methodology, etc.) Reinforce those strengths in future bids. If you lose, always request a debrief meeting or written feedback. Governments are usually willing to explain which areas your tender scored lower. Perhaps your methodology was not detailed enough or you lacked a certain experience compared to the winner. Use that feedback to identify gaps – maybe you need to partner or hire to fill that gap, or adjust how you present information. Maintain a log of this feedback.

Additionally, track metrics like bid success rate (e.g.  win 1 in 4 bids). If the ratio is low, you might refine your bid/no-bid criteria to focus on more winnable opportunities rather than burning resources on very large bids with slim chances. Conversely, if success rate is high, you might try for more ambitious opportunities gradually.

Implement a culture of continuous improvement in sales. For instance, after a couple of tenders, you might realize you get repeating questions about certain capability – then pre-write a strong response for that and use it going forward. Keep your reference project summaries updated as you complete more projects – nothing sells like proven experience, and over time your portfolio will grow.

Lastly, customer relationship management post-project is part of business development. After finishing a project, don’t let the relationship go cold. Check in with the client after a few months – see if they need any help implementing recommendations, or if they have upcoming needs. Many consulting engagements can lead to follow-on work or new referrals if the client is happy. Government clients move between departments often; a satisfied client in one department might bring you into their next department if you maintain contact. So consider even small gestures like sending a note or relevant industry news to past clients to stay on their radar (professional and not too frequent, of course).

By systematically building pipeline, nurturing relationships, and learning from each sales process, Mokai can steadily increase its win rate and scale up its contracts. The advantage of being an Indigenous business is significant, but it must be coupled with competitive, high-quality service offerings and strong selling practices to fully realize its potential in both government and enterprise markets.

### Risk & Compliance

#### Insurance Requirements:

Operating as a cybersecurity consultancy, you need to carry several types of insurance both for contractual compliance and prudent risk management. Professional Indemnity (PI) Insurance is essential – it covers claims of negligence or mistakes in your professional advice or services. Most government contracts will mandate a certain minimum PI coverage (commonly anywhere from $1 million to $5 million). Similarly, Public Liability Insurance is required to cover third-party injury or property damage (e.g. if you’re on a client site and something happens). Often a $10 million public liability policy is a standard requirement. If you are reselling products, sometimes Product Liability is mentioned (though typically the manufacturer holds that, but contracts often list it). And since you have an employee, Workers’ Compensation Insurance is legally required to cover any work-related injuries to employees. In fact, government buyers routinely check that suppliers have these insurances in place; buyers commonly require PI, public liability, product liability, and workers’ comp insurance in their contracts. Before starting, get quotes and obtain these policies. Also consider Cyber Liability Insurance for your own business – this may not be explicitly required by clients (though some forward-looking contracts do ask if you have it), but as a cybersecurity firm handling client data, it’s wise to have coverage in case your firm is targeted or if you inadvertently cause a security incident. Keep proof of insurance (Certificates of Currency) ready to supply with bids. Also note the need for updated certificates annually – mark renewal dates on your calendar so you don’t let any policy lapse. Non-compliance with insurance requirements could void contracts or put you in breach, so it’s a straightforward but critical aspect of risk management.

#### Quality Assurance & Reputation Management:

To maintain and grow as a prime contractor, you must establish a reputation for reliability and quality. Implementing a basic Quality Assurance (QA) framework internally will help ensure every deliverable that goes out meets standards. This doesn’t have to be an elaborate ISO 9001 system at the start (though achieving ISO 9001 quality certification could be a differentiator down the track). Initially, it can be a set of standard operating procedures: e.g., every client deliverable is peer-reviewed, every project follows a defined plan, and every engagement ends with a client satisfaction survey. Develop templates for reports, runbooks for common tasks (like how to conduct an Essential 8 assessment step-by-step consistent with ACSC guidance), and checklists (for example, a checklist to review before sending a report: spell-check, client name correct throughout, all objectives addressed, etc.). These reduce human error and present a consistent face of Mokai.

Additionally, consider implementing a lessons learned register – after projects, note what could be improved and adjust processes accordingly. For instance, if you find that scope creep happened in a particular project, update your scoping template or training to better define scope next time. Over time, these incremental improvements form a de facto QA system.

Maintaining quality also means sometimes saying no or pushing back to clients to protect project integrity. If a client requests something that will jeopardize quality (like cutting the testing phase short), explain the risk and professionally advise against it or seek a scope change. Clients ultimately respect vendors who are transparent about ensuring a job is done right.

Your reputation as prime also hinges on ethical behavior and compliance. Always adhere to any regulatory requirements. For example, if you’re doing government work, you may come across sensitive information – handle it per classification rules (store securely, don’t discuss outside, etc.). Ensure all staff and contractors understand their obligations; you might have them sign a Code of Conduct or at least the contracts mention adherence to relevant laws and client policies. If you’re engaged in a project requiring security clearance, compliance with that is non-negotiable (discussed more below).

#### Contractor Vetting & Background Checks:

As mentioned in Prime Contractor Management, vetting isn’t just about skills – it’s also about trustworthiness. For government contracts, especially those involving sensitive data or systems, you should ensure contractors can qualify for security clearances if needed (Australian government clearances require citizenship and background checks). Even if a project doesn’t initially mandate clearance, it’s good practice to have at least a baseline personnel security check: e.g. sighting a National Police Check for contractors or asking if they’ve ever had a security clearance. Many cyber professionals who work in gov already hold a Baseline or NV1 clearance. Having cleared personnel in your network is a selling point for certain jobs (Defence or intelligence community work). If you land work that requires clearance and your chosen contractor isn’t cleared, you’ll have to sponsor their clearance – which you can do through the Defence Industry Security Program (DISP) if Mokai joins that. DISP membership is something to consider as you grow: it’s a framework to help businesses handle classified info and personnel clearances. Achieving DISP (even entry level) will reassure Defence clients that you take security seriously.

For each contractor, maintain a file with their credentials, any clearances, and a signed confidentiality agreement. Also verify their right to work (in Australia, basically citizenship or visa status – for government-sensitive work, you’ll likely only use citizens anyway). If a contractor will be handling particularly sensitive client data, you might run a credit check or other deeper vetting, though that’s less common in short-term contracting. The main thing is due diligence – if something goes wrong (say a data breach traced to a malicious insider), you need to show you took reasonable steps in hiring that person. Supply Nation doesn’t vet your staff, that’s on you.

#### Security Clearances & Security Requirements:

On many government engagements, especially at federal level, you’ll encounter security requirements. This can range from needing all devices to be encrypted to formal security clearances for personnel. Security Clearances (Baseline, NV1, NV2, etc.) are granted by AGSVA and can be time-consuming (Baseline might take a few weeks, NV1 a few months). Plan ahead: if you want to pursue Defence contracts, identify contractors who either have existing clearances or could be cleared (long-term Australian residents with clean records). If a contract requires a certain clearance level and you don’t have anyone, you might need to partner with a company that does, or hire a cleared consultant as an associate.

Some projects might require the company itself to have a facility clearance (through DISP) especially if handling classified material at your own office. At the start, probably you’ll do any classified work on the client’s site under their security, which is simpler. Ensure compliance with any security briefings the client gives – for example, they might require you to sign a confidentiality undertaking or complete cyber awareness training before accessing their systems.

#### If working on systems with personal or confidential data, data protection is a risk:
have internal rules like “no client data goes on personal devices, use client-provided secure transfer methods.” Implement basic cybersecurity practices in Mokai’s own operations too – it would be ironic and reputation-damaging if your consultancy suffered a breach. Use strong access controls, keep your own software updated (essentially follow the Essential Eight internally where applicable).

#### Documentation & Evidence Management:

In consulting, especially for compliance-oriented work, the amount of documentation can be large. You should establish an organized document management system – it could be a SharePoint or Google Drive with structured folders per project. Ensure access control (only those who need see a client’s data have access). During projects, collect evidence methodically: e.g., if doing an IRAP or Essential 8 assessment, log what documents were reviewed, what screenshots taken. Not only does this support your findings, it’s useful if later the client or an auditor questions something – you can readily show the evidence.

#### Also maintain records of communications:
confirm important decisions or scope changes in writing (email) so you have a trail. If a client ever claims “you didn’t deliver X,” you can refer to an agreed scope document or change log.

From a compliance standpoint, if a contract is under a certain framework (like if you ever do a project under DISP, they might audit how you handle classified docs), you need to have your evidence of compliance (like destruction certificates for any classified material you dispose of, etc.). But even generally, good documentation protects you in case of disputes. For example, if scope creep happened and you proceeded without formal change orders, you could end up not getting paid for extra work – avoid that by having documentation (emails where client agrees “yes please also do X which is out of scope” and mentioning it may impact cost).

Internally, keep your financial records and employee records well-organized too. As a small business, tax compliance (BAS, payroll tax if applicable, etc.) and any audits (like if Supply Nation or the ATO audits you) will go smoother if records are handy. Given confidentiality, have policies on how long to retain client data – many consulting firms purge client data after a certain period post-project to reduce liability. You might, for instance, agree to delete all client data 30 days after project completion unless otherwise requested. Document that in your engagement letters, and follow it.

#### Legal and Regulatory Compliance:

Aside from client-specific compliance, be aware of general laws affecting your operations. For example, the Privacy Act – if Mokai handles personal info (perhaps in a GRC project you review employee details or breach data), you have obligations to protect it. Also, as a company director, Harry has duties under corporations law to keep company solvent and proper financial records. Ensure you meet all statutory requirements (ASIC filings, taxes, etc.) as lapses there can indirectly tarnish your ability to win work (imagine a due diligence check showing your business isn’t in good standing).

#### Common Risk Scenarios:

Some risk scenarios to plan for include: a cybersecurity incident at Mokai itself (have an incident response plan – even if simple – for how you’d contain and communicate if your systems were breached; clients may ask about it in due diligence), liability for advice (e.g. you recommend something and it fails causing damage – ensure your contracts have appropriate liability caps and that you stick to professional standards to minimize this risk; your PI insurance covers the rest), contractor misconduct (screening helps, but also have clear terms that any misconduct = termination; and have contingencies as discussed).

By proactively addressing these areas – insurance, quality, vetting, security, documentation – you not only reduce the likelihood of something going wrong, but also build trust with clients. Many clients, especially in government, will informally assess your “maturity” in risk management: if you can confidently answer their queries about how you ensure quality or handle data securely, it gives them comfort in awarding you work. It shows Mokai may be a small business but operates with the diligence of a much larger firm, which is exactly what you want your brand to convey.

## Common Pain Points

No business model is without challenges, and the prime contractor approach using a contractor network has its share of pain points. Being aware of these common issues allows you to mitigate them proactively:

1. Contractor Management Challenges: Depending on contractors means you’re often juggling people who aren’t fully under your control. One pain point is availability – a contractor might be double-booked or pull out just when you need them. If Jack’s specialist network has competing commitments, Mokai could be left in the lurch. We addressed strategies like building a bench and early communication, but it remains a top challenge. Another issue is variable performance – not every contractor will meet expectations. If a contractor delivers subpar work, Mokai bears the responsibility to the client. Replacing them mid-project can be difficult and can risk project delays. This is why intense vetting and slowly scaling up responsibilities is crucial, but it’s an on-going management headache. There’s also the matter of contractor loyalty: since contractors are free agents, you risk scenarios like a contractor finishing a project and then the client later approaching that individual for follow-on work bypassing Mokai. Clear non-solicitation agreements and maintaining strong client relationships yourself are how you combat this, but it’s a concern. Essentially, managing a rotating cast of contractors can feel like herding cats – it requires constant attention and flexibility.

2. Client Expectation Management: Clients, especially those not used to working with small or Indigenous businesses, might have certain misconceptions or high demands. Some clients might expect an Indigenous firm to be cheaper (due to SME status), or conversely, they might worry that a small team can’t handle a large project. Scope expectations can also be misaligned; if a proposal isn’t crystal clear, a client might assume extra tasks are included. Scope creep is a notorious pain point – for example, during a GRC engagement the client might continually ask for “one more policy” or additional meetings beyond what was scoped. This can erode your margins and overwork your team unless you diplomatically set boundaries and execute change orders. Another expectation issue is turnaround time: in cybersecurity, sometimes clients come with urgent needs (like an audit finding they need fixed ASAP). As a nimble firm you can often win such work, but the expectation might be unrealistic timelines which put pressure on your contractors and quality. Setting realistic timelines and maybe building a bit of buffer (under-promise, over-deliver) can help.

Client education is sometimes needed – for instance, explaining why a proper penetration test cannot be done in 2 days, or why an IRAP assessment takes months (to those unfamiliar, it might seem excessive). Using your expertise to set the expectation early avoids later disappointment. Additionally, being an Indigenous business, you might encounter the unfortunate bias or “tokenism” attitude from some clients or partners – a perception that you’re there just to tick a box, not because of capability. Research shows Indigenous businesses often face negative buyer perceptions and tokenism. Overcoming this requires consistent professional delivery to prove any skeptics wrong, but encountering it can be frustrating. In worst cases, a large prime contractor might include you in a bid to meet IPP requirements and then sideline your contributions (a form of tokenism/power imbalance noted in industry). Choose partnerships carefully and assert the value you bring beyond the Indigenous aspect.

3. Scope Creep and Project Boundaries: As touched on, scope creep is a persistent threat to project success and profitability. It often starts innocently – a client asks, “Could you also look at XYZ?” during an assessment, or “Can we add an extra workshop for another team?” Especially in a relationship-driven model, you want to please the client, but saying yes without adjusting scope can lead to unpaid work and timeline overruns. This is a pain point because it puts you in a dilemma between client satisfaction and business discipline. The best prevention is a strong Statement of Work that clearly defines what is included and what is not. Then, you have a basis to gently remind the client: “Happy to help with XYZ; it is outside our original scope but we can do a change request for that.” Some clients will still push back (“Oh, I thought that was included, can’t you just do it?”). Training your team (and yourself) to handle these conversations is key – focus on the value and effort (“We absolutely can, but it will take an extra 3 days of work. We want to ensure we maintain quality, so we’d need to extend the project and associated cost for that addition.”). Many will understand; those who don’t, you may sometimes do a small extra task as goodwill if it’s minor – but be wary of setting precedent.

Another boundary issue is time creep – when projects drag beyond their planned duration because the client is slow to respond or provide info. This can tie up your resources and delay payment. To mitigate, put clauses in contracts that if client causes delay beyond X days, you can invoice for work done so far or charge standby fees for booked resources. Even if you don’t always enforce it, it sets the expectation that your time is valuable.

4. Competition and Differentiation: The cybersecurity consulting market is competitive, with big players (Big 4, larger IT firms) and many boutique specialists. Mokai’s differentiator is being Indigenous-owned plus perhaps a more personalized service. However, you will often compete with non-Indigenous firms that might have longer track records or bigger teams. A pain point can be pricing pressure – larger firms might undercut on certain bids (maybe using loss leaders) or conversely some clients assume you’ll be cheaper because you’re small. You have to justify your pricing by emphasizing the quality and unique value (and IPP advantage where applicable).

Another competitive challenge is credentialing: some clients may want certain certifications (CREST accreditation for pen testing services, ISO certifications, etc.). As a new small firm, Mokai might not have those immediately. You might lose some bids on that basis until you accumulate more credentials or partners. It can be discouraging but is part of building credibility.

Furthermore, there’s market education to do – some potential clients might not even realize there’s an Indigenous-owned option in cybersecurity. So differentiation also involves raising awareness. Over time, you might cultivate a niche (e.g. “Mokai is the go-to for government Essential Eight and IRAP in Indigenous sector”) and then expand.

5. Business Growing Pains: Related to growth considerations, there are pains like scaling operations. As you take on more projects, the informal processes might strain. You may find yourself stretched thin managing everything (which can lead to errors or slower response). Recognizing when a process needs formalizing or when to hire help (like a project coordinator or another full-time consultant) can be a pain point – too early and you increase overhead unnecessarily, too late and service suffers. This balancing act is tricky.

6. Financial Strains: We touched on cash flow; it remains a common pain when, say, a large invoice is delayed or a client disputes something and holds payment. You might feel the squeeze to pay contractors or other bills. Also, investing in proposals (bidding costs in time/money) can be burdensome if you hit a dry spell with no wins. Ensuring a financial buffer and possibly a line of credit is how to ease this, but it’s a stress point for many SMEs.

7. Cultural Load: As an Indigenous business, sometimes you have additional expectations placed on you – e.g. you might get numerous requests to participate in Indigenous business events, committees, or community initiatives. These are wonderful opportunities, but they also take time away from the core business tasks. Balancing community obligations with running the business can be challenging – you don’t want to say no to community, but you also must deliver for clients. It’s a unique pain point where time management and sometimes having Kelly or others represent Mokai at some events can help distribute the load.

Mitigating Pain Points: Many of these issues can be mitigated with the strategies we’ve discussed: strong contracts, clear communication, maintaining a bench of resources, building relationships and trust, and continuously improving internal processes. Also leverage mentors – other Indigenous business owners or small business mentors who have navigated these issues can provide advice (Supply Nation or IBA often run mentoring programs or peer networks). Sometimes just knowing that others have faced similar challenges helps you strategize and not feel overwhelmed.

It’s also wise to set realistic expectations with yourself and co-founders: things will go wrong occasionally. A contractor will ghost, a project will not profit, a bid will be lost. Have a plan for post-mortems when failures occur: analyze it, learn, then move forward without too much self-blame. This resilience in face of common hurdles is what will ultimately differentiate Mokai as a sustainable enterprise versus those that fold under pressure.

For example, many Indigenous businesses report challenges of small size and capacity and negative perceptions, yet those who thrive do so by leveraging partnerships, demonstrating consistent value, and educating clients on their capability. Knowing this, Mokai can face each pain point with a proactive stance – turning challenges into opportunities to refine your model.

#### Growth Considerations

As Mokai establishes itself, thoughts naturally turn to growth. Growth can mean higher revenue, more contracts, a bigger team, or new services – but it needs to be managed strategically.

Scaling Contractor Network vs. Building Internal Team: Initially, leveraging contractors is cost-effective and flexible – you pay for talent only when needed. However, as you accumulate steady work, you might find certain skills are in use constantly (e.g. a GRC consultant for continuous compliance work, or a penetration tester busy every month). At that point, hiring a full-time employee could make sense financially (their salary might be lower than the equivalent contractor cost over the year) and operationally (you can deploy them as needed without the overhead of re-contracting each time). Full-timers also allow development of internal IP and continuity – they carry knowledge from project to project. The trade-off is reduced flexibility and increased fixed cost. A common heuristic: when a particular role is utilized, say, 60-70% of the time on projects, consider hiring in-house. Another factor is availability – an employee will prioritize your work above all, whereas a contractor might have other clients.

You might start by hiring at least one senior consultant or project manager as an employee to work under Jack – someone who can manage projects day-to-day and even supervise contractors on-site. This takes some load off Jack and ensures quality. Also, a business development or sales role might be a hire once revenue supports it, to help you expand pipeline (though often the CEO continues leading sales in small firms for a while).

One nuance for Indigenous businesses is talent sourcing: ideally, you want to bring in Indigenous talent to your core team if possible (both to reinforce the mission and possibly to move toward majority-Indigenous staff). However, the pool of highly experienced Indigenous cybersecurity professionals is not large. You might consider hiring a promising Indigenous graduate or early-career professional and providing mentorship and training. This is an investment – short-term they won’t bring in new revenue, but long-term you’re building capacity (and it can also open up grants or support for training Indigenous staff).

When to hire vs. use contractors also depends on the type of work: if it’s strategic to your future (like building a proprietary product or methodology), those doing it might be better as employees so the knowledge stays in-house. If it’s commodity or occasional (like needing a specialist in an uncommon system once a year), contracting out makes more sense indefinitely.

Building Internal IP vs. Staying a Pure Broker: In the early phase, Mokai’s value-add might be primarily matchmaking (connecting clients with Jack’s network and managing the project). Over time, to differentiate and grow margins, developing some internal intellectual property (IP) or proprietary methodology is beneficial. This could be as simple as a unique framework for Essential Eight improvements, or as complex as a software tool (for example, a portal for clients to track their compliance status). Internal IP could allow you to productize some offerings (like selling a subscription to a compliance check tool along with consulting). It also increases company valuation beyond just contracts.

Staying a pure broker (just reselling people’s time) can limit growth, because your business becomes a “body shop” competing mostly on relationships and possibly price. Building IP – whether in processes or products – shifts you toward a consulting firm with assets. For example, some consultancies develop templates and automated scripts for assessments that let them do work faster and more consistently than competitors. Document your approach in manuals, create checklists (as we’ve discussed), and that collection itself becomes Mokai’s internal IP library. If you can brand a service (like “Mokai’s Rapid IRAP Readiness Toolkit”), that helps marketing and possibly allows higher fees.

However, don’t get too distracted by product development unless there’s a clear market need and you have resources. Many services firms attempt to build a software product on the side and it can drain focus and cash. A middle ground is using technology to streamline service delivery (like using a GRC software platform to deliver assessments efficiently) – some vendors might offer partner deals for that.

Diversification of Client Base (Government vs. Enterprise): Thus far we focused on government, but enterprise (private sector) can be a great growth avenue. Government work can be lumpy (depending on budgets and politics) and is often project-based. Enterprise clients might give more recurring work (e.g. managed services contracts, ongoing retainer consulting like vCISO services). Ideally, aim for a mix: government projects for revenue spikes and credibility, plus some corporate clients for stable income.

The approach to win enterprise differs: corporate procurement doesn’t have IPP, so your Indigenous status might still help via RAP commitments but it’s not mandated. They care more about outcomes, cost, and risk. Use any government success as case studies to reassure corporates (“if we can meet strict govt standards, we can help you too”). Also, target industries that have strong Indigenous engagement programs: e.g. mining, banking, and infrastructure companies often are actively seeking Indigenous suppliers as part of their ESG goals.

To break in, consider alliances with larger IT service providers who serve corporates – maybe you partner on a project for a bank where you take a piece of work as the cyber specialists. Or join industry associations (like a Chamber of Commerce or an IT industry group) to network with corporate IT leaders.

One potential niche to differentiate in enterprise: positions Mokai as the go-to firm for companies seeking to improve their security while also meeting their Reconciliation goals. For instance, a bank might find it appealing to hire an Indigenous firm for a security assessment – it hits two objectives at once. But you need to market that value proposition and ensure you have the quality to back it up.

Service Portfolio Expansion: Growth can also come from adding new services. For example, you may decide to develop a managed security monitoring service in a few years, or a training offering (cyber awareness training tailored to Indigenous communities or broader). When considering expansion, check if it aligns with your core competencies and market demand. It might be better to deepen expertise in your current areas initially (be the best at Essential 8/IRAP/GRC in government, for instance) before expanding horizontally.

Geographical Expansion: Right now, likely focused on NSW/Australia federal. As you grow, you could consider other regions (e.g. open an office or hire someone in Canberra since federal clients are there, or expand to state govts like Queensland or Victoria). There’s also potential in the Asia-Pacific if you become known (some APAC branches of multinationals or nearby governments might find an Indigenous Australian firm interesting), but that’s down the track. Each expansion will require understanding new market nuances (e.g. different state procurement rules, etc.).

Balancing Growth with Indigenous Mission: A unique growth consideration is maintaining the Indigenous character and mission of Mokai. Rapid growth by taking on external investors or merging with another firm could risk diluting Indigenous ownership below 51%. Be cautious with any moves that would affect control – staying Supply Nation certified is not just a checkbox, it’s central to your identity and market advantage. Growth strategies should include how to bring other Indigenous professionals along – maybe forming a network of Indigenous cyber consultants, or eventually hiring more Indigenous staff and even training them (helping grow that talent pipeline). Not only is this fulfilling your broader mission, it also strengthens your IPP positioning (some contracts might start asking not just ownership but Indigenous employment numbers, as some government policies encourage employing Indigenous people too).

Timing and Planning for Growth: It’s advisable to create a simple growth plan or roadmap. For instance:

Year 1: Establish credentials with a few government contracts, get Supply Nation certified, maybe join 1-2 panels.

Year 2: Hire first full-time consultant, increase marketing to enterprise, aim for recurring contracts.

Year 3: Achieve say $X revenue, consider additional hires (maybe a sales lead), invest in one proprietary tool or methodology development.

Year 4-5: Expand service lines or geographic reach as needed, possibly go for ISO certifications or higher DISP level to unlock defense sector fully, etc.


This plan shouldn’t be rigid, but having targets helps measure if you’re growing in a healthy way.

Be prepared that growth often requires process formalization – what worked with 3 people might break with 10 people. At some stage you’ll introduce more formal HR, documented policies, perhaps a rudimentary HR or finance system instead of just spreadsheets. The transition from a start-up style to a small company is itself a pain point but a necessary evolution.

#### Utilizing Support Programs:

Don’t forget there are growth support avenues: Indigenous Business Australia (IBA) offers business loans and sometimes grants for expansion, and mentoring. Supply Nation and state Indigenous chambers often have programs to help Indigenous businesses scale (like business coaching, or pitching you to corporate members). Take advantage of those networks; sometimes they can lead to big contract opportunities when a corporate specifically asks Supply Nation for a capable cyber firm, you want Mokai to be top of mind.

In growth, also be mindful of not stretching too far too fast. A classic failure mode is winning too much work and not being able to deliver well, damaging reputation. It’s okay to turn down opportunities if they don’t fit or you’re not confident you can execute with current resources. Better to grow sustainably than implode from a giant contract that goes wrong. Build capacity slightly ahead of demand, but based on realistic pipeline.

Ultimately, consider what the end game might be: Do you envision Mokai growing to a mid-size consultancy with dozens of staff and perhaps eventually being acquired by a larger firm or continuing as a thriving Indigenous enterprise that maybe you pass on or take public? Different end goals might influence strategy (an acquisition-focused strategy might focus on building IP and recurring revenue, whereas a long-term family business might focus on community impact and steady growth). These are long-term thoughts, but choices you make each year (like bringing in investors or not, focusing on one sector or diversifying) will set that trajectory.

In summary, scaling up will involve careful addition of internal staff, development of unique value (IP), broadening the client base beyond just the initial niche, and doing all this while preserving the Indigenous essence of Mokai. By planning for these aspects, you can avoid common growth traps and position the company to not only increase in size but also in strength and impact.
