Hi, I was just wondering who I can talk to about the application process for SupplyNation. Just wanted to get a little bit of advice on my application. I've just recently become officially recognised as an Indigenous Australian and looking to get my businesses certfied.

I operate two separate businesses - one 100% owned in creative, one 51% owned in tech. Both eligible. Can I register both, and is there a recommended sequence?"

If they hesitate or flag concerns, _then_ you can decide whether to pursue MacKay registration later. But I'd bet money they'll say it's fine.

**Bottom line:** Your paranoia isn't entirely irrational given the recent Supply Nation controversy in the news, but your specific situation (legitimate businesses, correct ownership %, different industries) is textbook eligible.

“I’m planning to register my 100% Indigenous-owned business and, in parallel, I am in the process of setting up a second, independent business that meets the 51% Indigenous-owned and controlled standard, as per Supply Nation’s requirements for certification.

Both are genuine, separate entities focused on different industries. I’d like to ensure I provide everything Supply Nation needs from the outset to support efficient assessment—are there any extra steps or disclosures I should include when applying for a second business? And for a new business not trading yet, what is best practice for demonstrating intent to trade and eligibility?”

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Both businesses follow a **prime contractor, project-based managed services model**, facilitating subcontractors as needed.</mark>
