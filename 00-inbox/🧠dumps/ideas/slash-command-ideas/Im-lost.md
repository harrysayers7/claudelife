I am lost and do not know what to do next

Ask me 10-12 questions about my current situation, however you see fit, and help me
identify my next 5 moves.

Ensure the questions get to the core reasoning to why I am stuck that are not obvious
to me.

Ask the questions one by one so bias is not reflected in either the questions or the
answers.

After you have asked the questions, outlay my next 5 moves to help me move
forward, and also adopt an "If then" approach for what I should do for certain
