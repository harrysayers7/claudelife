🧠 HARRY’S LEARNING ROADMAP — CYBERSECURITY & SOFTWARE RESELLING FOCUS


---

🎯 Your Role in Plain Terms

You are:

> The strategic and commercial leader of Mokai — responsible for how money flows, how partnerships are built, and how government clients buy from you.



Jack handles the technical credibility (vendors, cybersecurity delivery).
You handle the business architecture (contracts, finance, procurement, partnerships, IPP leverage).


---

### 🧱 1. Channel & Reseller Business Model (Your Core Knowledge Base)

Learn:

What a reseller and value-added reseller (VAR) actually does.

How vendor partner programs work (tiers, certifications, rebates).

How margin structures operate — wholesale vs retail, rebates, renewals.

What Master Reseller Agreements look like (pricing, liability, renewal terms).


Focus:

You must understand the mechanics of recurring margin revenue — i.e., how you make $1 on every $10, over and over.

Resources:

Microsoft Partner Program Overview (learn partner tiers and margins)

Ingram Micro / Dicker Data documentation (Australian distributor models)

YouTube: “How VARs and MSPs make money” (20-min overviews are gold)

HubSpot: “Channel Sales Explained”



---

### 🏛️ 2. Government Procurement & IPP Mastery

This is your biggest unfair advantage. You need to understand it inside out.

Learn:

IPP (Indigenous Procurement Policy) rules — particularly Exemption 16 and Mandatory Set-Asides.

How Supply Nation certification affects buyer behaviour.

How panels, standing offers, and tenders actually function in practice.

The anatomy of a purchase order → invoice → payment → renewal flow for government buyers.

Compliance documents that matter: insurance, cyber certifications, policies.


Focus:

You must be fluent in the language of procurement officers — talk “compliance, Indigenous spend, value-for-money” instead of “sales.”

Resources:

IPP Guidelines (Finance.gov.au)

AusTender and Digital Transformation Agency procurement portals

Supply Nation’s Corporate Partnerships pages — understand what corporates need from you



---

### 💰 3. Financial Modelling & Margin Management

You will be managing the money engine — not the tech.

Learn:

How to model gross margin, net margin, and ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue).

How vendor payments and client renewals affect cash flow cycles.

How to price resold software: base cost + margin + GST + support fees.

How to build a profit model spreadsheet that projects monthly license volumes and renewal rates.

How to set up renewal tracking in Notion or Airtable.


Tools:

Xero for real-time P&L

Airtable or Notion CRM for renewal tracking

Airwallex for international vendor payments



---

### 📜 4. Contracting & Legal Frameworks

You need to know the structure of agreements — not how to draft them.

Learn:

Key clauses in Master Reseller Agreements (pricing, liability, renewals, territory).

Structure of Client Procurement Contracts (SOWs, T&Cs, payment milestones).

Risk allocation — who’s liable for what (you vs vendor vs client).

Basics of software licensing terms (seat-based, usage-based, enterprise license).


Focus:

Be able to read and interpret agreements confidently before sending them to a lawyer.

Resources:

Vendor partner agreement examples (Microsoft, Atlassian, CrowdStrike)

LegalVision & Lawpath blogs on reseller agreements

Book: Business Contracts Made Simple (Australian context)



---

### 📊 5. Vendor Relationship Management

Your edge will come from strong relationships with key vendors.

Learn:

How vendor partner account managers operate.

How channel incentives work (rebates, training credits, MDF marketing funds).

How to negotiate better margin tiers or exclusive Indigenous partnership status.

How to forecast renewals and manage volume targets for rebates.


Focus:

Vendors will give you better pricing and early access if you’re easy to deal with, structured, and credible.

Resources:

Vendor partner portals (Microsoft, Palo Alto, Make.com, Atlassian, SentinelOne)

Read Channel Futures and CRN Australia for real vendor-dealer news



---

### 🧮 6. Cybersecurity Service Literacy (Business, Not Technical)

You don’t need to do the pen tests — but you need to speak the language.

Learn (conceptually):

What the ASD Essential Eight controls are (baseline cyber maturity).

What an IRAP assessment is and when agencies need one.

How ISO 27001 certification works.

The difference between GRC consulting, penetration testing, and architecture reviews.


Focus:

Be able to talk confidently with procurement managers or CISOs about “what problem Mokai solves” — without technical jargon.

Resources:

ASD Essential Eight Maturity Model (Cyber.gov.au)

ISO 27001 summary guides

YouTube: “ASD Essential Eight explained in 10 minutes”



---

### 🧩 7. Systems & Process Architecture

You’ll run the operational backbone — not the delivery systems, but the business flow.

Learn:

CRM setup for tracking deals, vendors, and renewals

Invoice automation and margin reporting

Vendor license tracking (Notion / Airtable)

Integration between finance and CRM (e.g., Xero + Airwallex + Make.com)


Outcome:

You’ll be able to see:

> “Which client bought what, when it renews, what our margin is, and when to invoice again.”



That’s how you build recurring stability.


---

### 🎓 8. Soft Skills & Positioning Mastery

You must learn how to speak like a procurement partner, not a vendor.

Learn:

Procurement psychology — what makes risk-averse buyers say yes.

How to frame Mokai as a “trusted Indigenous prime contractor” rather than a small supplier.

How to run partner and client meetings confidently (especially with vendor channel reps).

How to communicate “compliance + Indigenous value” fluently.


Practice:

Rehearse explaining Mokai in one line:

> “We’re an Indigenous-certified technology consultancy that helps government and corporates meet security and procurement targets through trusted software and cybersecurity partnerships.”
