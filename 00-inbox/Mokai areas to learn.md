Got it ✅ — if we park SaaS as a future diversification play, then your real focus now is:

Win contracts via IPP/APP leverage

Design the lean recruitment-led ops model

Oversee finance & compliance frameworks

Build Mokai’s positioning and narrative

Stay one step above technical delivery (that’s Jack’s lane)

🔑 What You Should Master Right Now

1. Government Procurement (IPP/APP)

This is your main weapon. If you know the pathways cold, you unlock revenue. Udemy searches:

“Government procurement / public sector contracting (Australia/UK focus)”

“Tender writing for public sector”

“Indigenous procurement / supplier diversity” (if available, but rare) 👉 This lets you structure Mokai as a sole-source Indigenous prime and know when/how to bypass open tenders.

---

2. Operating Model & Business Architecture

Your job is to design the machine Jack runs inside. Udemy searches:

“Business architecture essentials / Target Operating Model”

“Operating model design for services”

“Productizing consulting services” 👉 This gets you SOPs, RACI charts, and frameworks so Mokai runs cleanly with contractors.

---

3. Finance & Risk Oversight

Keep control of cashflow, margins, compliance obligations. Udemy searches:

“Xero for business owners (Australia BAS/GST)”

“Cash flow forecasting for SMEs”

“Professional services pricing / value-based pricing”

“Risk management ISO 31000 for non-specialists” 👉 You won’t do daily accounting, but you’ll know how to set the rules (when contractors get paid, margin targets, and risk registers).

---

4. Stakeholder & Strategic Storytelling

You’re the face of Mokai in boardrooms — not the tech lead, but the strategist. Udemy searches:

“Stakeholder management / executive communication”

“Strategic storytelling for leaders”

“Negotiation for business / public sector” 👉 This helps you turn Indigenous ownership + assurance-first credibility into a story that wins trust.

---

🏹 Priority Order (short list)

If I had to cut it down to just one course each stage, here’s the sequence:

1. Government Procurement Fundamentals (Public Sector) → unlock IPP contracts now.

2. Operating Model Design / Business Architecture → build Mokai’s delivery engine.

3. Xero for Business Owners (Australia) → financial hygiene & contractor payments.

4. Strategic Storytelling for Leaders → sharpen your pitch to agencies & primes.

---

So — Jack masters ISO 27001 / ASD8 / IRAP delivery. You master IPP, operating model, finance, and positioning. That’s the clean division.
