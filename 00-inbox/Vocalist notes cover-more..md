### Chorus of Care

-  Main note would just be to focus on energy building towards the end. Ensuring that last "cover-more" really crescendos into the whistle.
-  The accent I use is probably a little bit too American. I would imagine they would like it more Australian sounding? Not sure how Australian we should go? Maybe a second more bogan version could be handy.

### Co👏 ver 👏 more 👏 - Clap

- Vibing the interesting harmonies in my demo so would like to keep those but definetly open to ideas or addition harmonies if you hear any!
- Looking for a sort of percussive approach to the vocals to go with the claps - maybe a more aggressive version and softer version if possible?
### Echoed Protection

-  Apologies for this one. I didn't exactly sing this to the grid, but luckily there's not any instrumentation, so happy for you to just get it close enough to my demo. I can always redo the whistle as well.  I provided a metronome, so you can just sing to that if you like.

### Final Note

Feel free to have a go at the whistles too!
