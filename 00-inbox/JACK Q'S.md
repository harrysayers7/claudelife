Two Essential Questions for Jack
Question 1: Pricing & Contractor Economics
"Jack, can you walk me through the financial mechanics of a typical cybersecurity engagement? Specifically:

What do clients typically pay per day for different types of work (pen testing, IRAP, Essential Eight assessments)?
What day rates do you pay contractors for those same services?
What's the standard margin that makes sense for Mokai as the prime contractor managing everything?
And critically - what's the payment timing? When does the client pay you vs when do you need to pay contractors? How do you manage that cash flow gap?"

Why this question first:



Establishes fundamental business economics
Shows whether the model is financially viable
Reveals the working capital challenge you'll face immediately
Gives you concrete numbers to build financial projections
Shows what margins are realistic for Mokai's prime contractor role


Question 2: Government Procurement Reality Check
"Based on your experience, how do government cybersecurity contracts actually work in practice? Specifically:

What's the typical path from identifying an opportunity to winning the work? (tender, panel, direct approach?)
What do agencies actually look for when selecting a provider?
What documentation and credentials do we need to be credible (insurance levels, case studies, certifications)?
And honestly - how do you think Mokai being Indigenous-owned (51% Harry) changes our positioning and opportunities in the government market?"

Why this question second:

Validates whether your Indigenous procurement advantage is real or theoretical
Shows the actual procurement pathways you'll pursue
Identifies capability gaps you need to address
Tests Jack's understanding of how IPP/Exemption 16 works
Reveals whether he sees the Indigenous ownership as advantage or complication
