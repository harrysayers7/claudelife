Here's a feature list based on each AI project in the video:
 * OPC Code [00:26]
   * Powerful GUI toolkit for Claude Code
   * Command center for Claude: create custom agents, manage projects, track usage analytics, spin up background AI tasks.
   * Built with Tauri 2 for a cross-platform interface.
   * Controls project sessions, cost tracking, version timelines, and model context protocol server management.
 * Fast MCP v2 [01:11]
   * Pythonic framework for building MCP servers and clients.
   * Production-grade framework for real-world MCP applications.
   * Includes enterprise authentication, deployment tools, testing utilities, and OpenAPI/FastAPI generation.
   * Enables creation of production-grade MCP endpoints with a few lines of Python.
 * Dyad [01:56]
   * Open-source AI app builder that runs entirely on your machine.
   * Similar to Lovable Vzero or Bolt, but with full ownership.
   * Builds full-stack AI apps locally, powered by Supabase for OAuth, databases, and server functions.
   * Supports various models: Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT 4.1, Claude Sonnet 4, and local LLMs.
   * Prioritizes speed, privacy, and frictionless experience.
 * Rust GPT [02:38]
   * Complete transformer-based language model built entirely in Rust.
   * No PyTorch, TensorFlow, or external ML frameworks.
   * Rebuilds LLM from scratch using only end for matrix operations.
   * Includes pre-training, instruction tuning, full backpropagation, and interactive chat mode.
   * Designed as a learning playground for understanding LLM mechanics.
 * Paper2Agent [03:13]
   * Transforms research papers into interactive AI agents.
   * Automatically scans GitHub repositories from scientific papers, sets up environments, and generates ready-to-use AI agents.
   * Agents can run original experiments, analyze new data, and answer questions based on the paper's code.
   * Connects to Claude Code or Google Gemini CLI, builds local MCP servers, and runs pipelines like Alpha Genome.
 * Quen 3 Omni [04:03]
   * Omnimodal foundation model that processes audio, text, and vision.
   * Integrates modalities in a single "thinker talker" architecture.
   * Offers real-time streaming and natural-sounding speech output.
   * Supports 119 text languages and 10 speech output languages.
   * Achieves state-of-the-art benchmarks on 32 multimodal tasks.
 * Pepper [04:48]
   * Event-driven system for proactive AI assistants.
   * Assistants fetch and summarize emails, and work on tasks in the background.
   * Core architecture is a continuous "sense, think, act" loop with feeds, scheduler, and workers.
   * Introduces asynchronous tool calls, event queues, and context stores for parallel AI processes.
 * Prompt Enhancer (Hunuan) [05:32]
   * Upgrade for text-to-image AI models.
   * Rewrites prompts via an intelligent chain of thought process to clarify intent.
   * Refines prompts, preserves style and layout, and improves alignment between text and image.
   * Acts as a translator between human imagination and diffusion model logic.
 * AI SDK Tools [06:07]
   * Toolkit for building powerful AI applications, extending Vercel AI SDK.
   * Features state management, real-time debugging, and structured artifact streaming.
   * Built on Zustand for global state control and real-time tool monitoring.
   * Offers production-grade reliability with full TypeScript support.
 * AGUI (Agent User Interaction Protocol) [06:38]
   * Open, event-based standard for AI agents to connect with real-time user interfaces.
   * Backends emit 16 standardized AGUI events for messages, state updates, and UI actions.
   * Lightweight, flexible, and transport-agnostic (WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, webhooks).
   * Enables real-time chat, bidirectional sync, and generative UIs.
 * Shimmy [07:14]
   * Privacy-first alternative to Ollama, a drop-in replacement for OpenAI API.
   * Lightweight (4.8 MB) single binary providing OpenAI-compatible endpoints for GGUF models.
   * Allows existing AI tools to work locally and privately with zero configuration.
   * Automatically discovers models from Hugging Face or local directories, allocates ports, and detects LoRA adapters.
 * Chrome MCP Server [07:55]
   * Model Context Protocol server that turns Chrome browser into an AI automation hub.
   * Enables LLMs or chatbots (like Claude) to control the browser, automate tasks, analyze content, and run semantic searches.
   * Uses existing browser session with configurations, login, and extensions.
   * Local and private, supporting over 20 tools (screenshot, network monitoring, bookmark management, intelligent tab analysis).
 * QA [08:39]
   * Open-source infrastructure for computer use agents (Docker for AI agents).
   * Controls full desktops (macOS, Linux, Windows) inside secure virtual sandboxes.
   * Computer SDK automates real operating systems with a simple PyAutoGUI-like API.
   * Manages VMs locally or through QA cloud for testing, training, or deploying desktop-controlling AI.
 * MCP for Beginners by Microsoft [09:16]
   * Open-source curriculum teaching the Model Context Protocol from the ground up.
   * Real-world examples across .NET, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, Rust, and Python.
   * Covers session setup to service orchestration, standardizing communication between AI models and client applications.
   * Includes official documentation, code samples, and community resources.
 * Coding Agent Template [10:00]
   * Ready-to-deploy foundation for AI-powered coding assistants.
   * Supports multiple agent backends (Claude Code, OpenAI Codec CLI, Cursor CLI, Google Gemini CLI, Open Code).
   * Seamlessly integrated with Vercel Sandbox for secure code execution.
   * Features real-time task tracking, AI-generated branch names, Neon Postgres storage, and Git automation.
   * Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS for a modern UI.
