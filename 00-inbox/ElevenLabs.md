Studio, our longform text-to-audio editor for creators and storytellers, is now available to everyone.

Bring your audiobooks, voiceovers, articles, and even podcasts to life with multiple characters, fine-grained voice customization, pacing control, and more.

We first launched Studio in 2023 under its previous name of Projects, and it was only available to users with a paid subscription. Since then, we’ve released dozens of new features and upgrades, and now we want everyone to experience the magic of Studio, regardless of which plan you’re on.

Free users can create, edit and export up to three projects in Studio. If you have a paid subscription, there are no limits on how many projects you can make.

Hear from Jonathan, one of the engineers behind the updates:

Some of Studio’s recent upgrades include:

Pacing control
Pause Control in Studio
Pause Control in Studio
One of the most-requested features from our community was the ability to add pauses and breaks to sections of speech. You can now add breaks lasting between 0.1 seconds and 3 seconds through the menu bar.

Auto-assignment of voices

When you import an audiobook or script with multiple characters, we’ll assign a different voice to each character. Doing this manually took a long time, so this new feature will save you a lot of time.

GenFM now available in Studio, with additional features
GenFM Podcast Creation in Studio
GenFM Podcast Creation in Studio
GenFM makes it easy to create podcast-style discussions between AI voices using any source material you can find. Either upload a document or import some content from a URL, choose whether you want a conversation between a Host and Guest, or just a bulletin from a Host, and click Generate. GenFM will create a fully editable podcast exploring your content.
