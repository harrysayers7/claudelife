Is there a smart way to create a intelligence detector so Claude would be able to detect somehow that something would be very useful as a chord code hook instead of a rule in the claw.md or in the agent instructions or slash command

---


Also I would like to make a way that when I use the extract-context slash command it would also detect whether the conetxt is relevant to update any sub agents system prompts or context files in each area in 00-areas that would benefit from having this context in its system prompt as well.

like say it was "i like to learn visually" then Claude would recognize that that would be relevant for Mokai or mokhouse because of its relevant to the  business and would benefit from knowing this so the agent can perform effectively to my preferences.

It would need to ensure it doesnt conflict with any current context in the context files of an area and

Make sure properties type: context
