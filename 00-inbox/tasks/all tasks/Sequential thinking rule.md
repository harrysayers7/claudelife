### ðŸ§© Sequential Thinking Rule

Use **Sequential Thinking** whenever a task involves multiple dependent steps that must be reasoned about, executed, or verified in order.
If the goal cannot be achieved safely or accurately with a single generation or tool call â€” such as refactoring, debugging, API integrations, or multi-file edits â€” enable Sequential Thinking.
For short, atomic edits or simple code explanations, disable it to keep responses faster and simpler.
