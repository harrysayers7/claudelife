#### is there a way to set it up? are the pros doing it a certain way

Yes, you can set up Claude Code to **automatically switch models or manage hybrid model workflows**, and that’s exactly what experienced users and engineering teams are doing. There isn’t a single “auto model” button yet, but pros configure layer-based defaults and aliases that intelligently balance power, speed, and cost.

### Recommended Professional Setup

Professionals and teams typically use a **tiered configuration** across project, user, and session levels:

1. **Environment Variable Default**
   Add this to your shell config (`.zshrc` or `.bashrc`):
   ```
   export ANTHROPIC_MODEL=opusplan
   ```
   This makes Claude Code start in a hybrid mode—Opus for planning, Sonnet for execution—without needing to type it each time[1][2].

2. **Project-Level Configuration**
   For multi-repo work, pros store defaults in a project file:
   ```
   .claude/settings.json
   {
     "model": "opusplan"
   }
   ```
   This overrides the global setting for only that repository[2][3].

3. **Session Command Overrides**
   In active sessions, developers quickly adapt using:
   ```
   /model opus
   /model sonnet
   ```
   This gives granular control without restarting the process—handy for quickly switching from problem-solving (Opus) to refactoring (Sonnet)[2][1].

4. **Startup Flags for Specific Tasks**
   Teams running automations or scripts use startup flags like:
   ```
   claude --model sonnet
   ```
   That enforces model consistency across pipelines or CI/CD jobs[2].

### Pro-Level Hybrid Strategies

Most advanced users and teams rely on **“smart aliases”**:
- **opusplan** – Opus handles reasoning and documentation; Sonnet takes over for implementation.
- **default alias** – Begins on Opus but automatically drops to Sonnet once rate or cost thresholds near their limits.
These methods combine high-end reasoning with cost and latency optimization, achieving a pseudo–auto model selection effect[2][1].

### In Practice

Professional setups often look like this:
- Global `.zshrc` has `ANTHROPIC_MODEL=opusplan`
- Repo `.claude/settings.json` overrides with `"model": "sonnet"`
- Developers switch mid-session with `/model opus` when debugging complex logic.

This layered configuration delivers the same benefit as “smart detection” while preserving manual override control—exactly how top Claude Code engineers, AI research teams, and indie developers are configuring it right now[2][4].
