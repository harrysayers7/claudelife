For the /extract-daily-content command

Context shouldn't include diary entry And also don't add dates just add as a dot point under the last entry

For example if i say "today I built a supabase database for financial tracking for mokai" You would extract it as - well this is a database so it should go in the context-tech file to add to the tech stack. Add to context-mokai  as it is relevant to Mokai Financials.

You can add it to as many context files as you think would have it be relevant,

Include the link to the diary entry and to other context files
