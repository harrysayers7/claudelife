# Research Supply Nation multi-business registration best practices

Research the best approach for registering both MOK HOUSE and MOKAI with Supply Nation to avoid "black cladding" concerns.

## Context

Harry owns two legitimate 100% Indigenous-owned businesses:
1. **MOK HOUSE Pty Ltd** - Creative house (music composition, sonic branding, design)
2. **MOKAI Pty Ltd** - Indigenous technology consultancy (cybersecurity, GRC, IRAP)

Both businesses serve different markets and have different service offerings, but there's concern that registering both simultaneously might trigger Supply Nation's fraud detection ("black cladding" rule).

## Current Status
- MOK HOUSE website almost complete (built by Kell)
- Website completion is prerequisite for Supply Nation application
- Supply Nation certification pending for both businesses

## Research Questions

- [ ] What is Supply Nation's actual policy on owners with multiple businesses?
- [ ] Does Supply Nation have a formal process for multi-business owners?
- [ ] Should businesses be registered sequentially or can they be submitted together?
- [ ] Are there examples of Indigenous business owners successfully registering multiple businesses?
- [ ] What documentation is needed to demonstrate legitimate separate business operations?
- [ ] Is there a recommended timeframe between applications if done sequentially?

## Proposed Approach (to validate)

**Option 1: Sequential Registration**
1. Register MOK HOUSE first (website ready soon)
2. Wait for approval and establish track record
3. Register MOKAI later (6-12 months?)

**Option 2: Simultaneous with Explanation**
1. Submit both applications together
2. Include cover letter explaining:
   - Legitimate ownership structure
   - Different markets and service offerings
   - Business history and separation
   - Proactive transparency about multiple businesses

**Option 3: Contact Supply Nation First**
1. Call Supply Nation certification team
2. Explain situation upfront
3. Ask for guidance on best approach
4. Follow their recommended process

## Next Steps

1. Research Supply Nation's multi-business owner policy
2. Contact Supply Nation for guidance (likely best approach)
3. Prepare documentation showing business separation:
   - Different ABNs
   - Different service offerings
   - Different target markets
   - Separate financials
   - Separate operations
