Create a copy of every slash command, agent, hook and snippet and place in folders for each respective based on category: ie

This should be a copy of each files content but do not include the code as its purely for reference for me to read.
Also add a short 100 word summary of what the command/agent etc does at the top of the file (under the front matter)

### Frontmatter properties:
type: hook/agent etc
category: guides
