Create a copy of slash command, agent, hook and snippet and place in folders for each respective based on category: ie

This would server as a guide for me to read what each thing does 

This should be a copy of each files content but do not include the code as its purely for reference for me to read. Unless necessary
Also add a short 100 word summary of what the command/agent/hook etc does at the top of the file (under the front matter)

### Frontmatter properties: (example)
type: hook
category: guides
relation: [[claude-code]]
created date:
link: [link for hook in .claude]



Only apply this command to the following files:
[List slash command]

We will also needs to update the rules in any agenst or commands that are instructed to update the commands guide in 04-resources so they use this new approach

At the bottom is shoul
