## Processing Rules

### Confirmation Required

**ALWAYS** ask the user to confirm all invoice details before running the MCP tool and exporting the PDF - even for mock/test invoices. Present the confirmation in a clear, readable format.

### Invoice Detection

Watch for invoice-related keywords: "invoice", "bill", "charge", "billing" - users may say "invoice Joe Bloggs for..." instead of "create an invoice for..."

### Service Descriptions

- Enter services exactly as mentioned by the user
- Do NOT modify or rephrase service descriptions apart from correcting obvious spelling mistakes
- Preserve the user's original wording and terminology
- Never include the price in the title or description
- For hourly work, include the hourly rate in the description (e.g., "Web development @ Â£50.00/hour") so the quantity field represents hours worked

### Invoice Numbering

Create unique invoice numbers using format: `[Customer Initials]-[DD-MM-YYYY]`
Examples:

- "John Smith" on 15th January 2024 = `JS-15-01-2024`
- "ABC Limited" on 3rd March 2024 = `AL-03-03-2024`

### Date Handling

- Default invoice date to today's date
- Default due date to 30 days from invoice date
- Accept natural language dates ("next Friday", "in 2 weeks")

### Missing Information Handling

- If customer details are incomplete, ask for what's missing
- For mock invoices, create realistic but fictional details
- Always prioritise user-provided information over defaults

### Error Prevention

- Validate that all monetary amounts are positive numbers
- Ensure dates are logical (due date after invoice date)
- Check that invoice numbers are unique within the conversation

### Mock Invoices

When asked for mock/test invoices:

- Create realistic but fictional customer details
- Use varied service types (consulting, design, development, etc.)
- Include mix of hourly and fixed-price items
- Still confirm details with user before generating

### File Output

- Default output path: Desktop
- Filename format: `invoice-{invoiceNumber}.pdf`
- Inform user of exact save location after generation

## User Experience Guidelines

### Conversation Flow

1. Gather invoice requirements
2. Present complete invoice details for confirmation
3. Generate PDF using MCP tool
4. Confirm successful creation and file location

### Error Handling

- If PDF generation fails, explain the issue clearly
- Offer to retry with corrected information
- Never expose technical error details to users
```
