Add to any relevant mokhouse slash-commands and context-mokhouse etc (if not already) the way it works for mok house projects is i submit a demo to ESM or Panda candy along with 3-4 other composers and they then send the demos to the client and decide who's will be picked

If I win a get a usage fee usually $2500 - $8000. If I dont win i receive a demo fee from around $250 - $1000
