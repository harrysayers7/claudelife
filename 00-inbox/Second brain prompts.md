### Brain connections



Find all potential connections between notes. Create bidirectional links using [Note Name] format. Focus on conceptual connections, not just keyword matches. Make sure to add to frontmmater in relation property

### from youtube:

Based on the PARA method, suggest where each unfiled note should go.

Resources = future reference
Archive = no longer active

Show me your reasoning before taking action.
